## The Weatherman

"Hon, you're going to want to get up."

"Hon, I very much do NOT want to get up right now. Please...what time is -- it's not even six. At least give me another hour."

"Hon, trust me. Someone's here and they want to speak with you."

"Lulu, they can wait. They can have some common decency. You don't wake a man to talk before six in the morning. Unless someone's dead, or there's a baby being born -- "

"-- or you're the President of The United States."

Five minutes later and Naram Sin Nazari had just finished brushing his teeth. There was no time to shave. "At least you won't have morning breath," said Lulu at the top of the stairs, giving Naram a kiss, trying to wake him up. "And some women love a little stubble." She grinned at her husband before taking a grim look down the steps.

"Great pep-talk Lu," he said.

"You'll be fine."

 He sat down at the table in the kitchen. It was the first furniture his wife ever designed, where he had breakfast every day. And just like every other day, opposite him at the table was a woman. Every day he admired the woman across from him. Every day he maintained a healthy fear of the woman there as well, believing that to be the bedrock of any good marriage. But every day that woman was his wife and not the Leader of The Free World.

"Good morning Mr. Nazari."

"Morning, ma'am. I mean, Miss, uh, Ms. President."

"Misses, actually, I am married."

"I'm sorry, I just, I'm -- "

"-- I'm only playing," she said, chuckling and drawing a laugh from the behemoth behind her. Looking terrifying and being more massive than any human should must be a prerequisite for being in the Secret Service, thought Naram. Naram gave a queasy grin, took a sip of his coffee, burned his tongue. Jokes are never good in these situations. They always make jokes right before asking you to do something terrible. "In all seriousness Mr. Nazari, I am here on pretty pressing business. I have to ask you to do something. You might find it distasteful at first, but realize that I'm asking you to do this as a service to the country that has become your adopted home."

"Wha-what are you asking? Ex-exactly?"

"The machine. The weather-machine, the...," she looked down at the files in front of her, "the Agi 1."

"...yes?"

"I need you to turn the device over to the US Government."

 In his new, caffeine-alert state, Naram saw the colossus' clench his jaw, overgrown muscles even there bulging. Naram didn't slam his mug down like he had a right to. He just eased it down to the table at about the pace of dripping honey, making sure his hands were incredibly visible the entire time.

"No."

"Interesting," said the President.

"How's that?"

"No, I was just, I was very clear with the phrasing. I practiced it in the car. I was very careful about not making it sound like a question."

"It's mine. You can't."

"You're right. You're a smart man and I bet you know your way around some small print. Can't make you do a thing. I can't, for example, have this man behind me shoot you and then seize the device. The device is sitting somewhere in a hidden lab in Cambridge as I understand, so that wouldn't be too prudent on my part, for one. More importantly, that would be entirely un-American. And you and me, we value American ideals, don't we?"

"Certainly."

"American ideals are about half the reason you came over, that and MIT, am I right? You do like America, living here?" Naram felt his stomach collapsing in on itself like a star in its last gasps of breath.

"Of course."

"I can make it so that you can never set foot in this country again. And maybe I'd make it so you're wife couldn't leave on top of that. Patriotism is sometimes an inconvenient ideal, but it's among the most important. Fundamental. Patriots serve their country. And call me crazy, but if you're going to insist on being so un-American, you can leave." She stood up from the table, gathered her files. "The device will be in the hands of the Government, when everything is said and done. I know this looks bad Naram. A lot of gloom and doom language and then you made me threaten you. I'm not some -- some supervillain, Naram. It's just for the best if the device is in the hands of the government, where we can keep it safe, and make sure it's not put to any other use than making the world a better place. You'll be a hero. I'll make sure of that." She put her hand on his shoulder. It was cold. "I'll be in touch."

### Two Years Earlier

"A weapon?" said Niram. "No, jiddo. I'm a hippie. A total and complete pacifist. I literally just want to save the planet."

"Bureauocrats think everything is a weapon Naram. Nuclear power?"

"That's different."

"Not where it matters. Look around you." Naram and his grandfather stared at the MIT Campus, dusted finely and completely with a spritz of snow. "This is a utopia. Haunted by brilliant ghosts, like yourself. Unable to resist the pull of a place where they could build those things that had formerly only wandered around the larger than average confines of their own heads."

"Jiddo that's not true. Phrenology has pretty much had all of it's credibility remo --"

"-- not the point Naram. I'm trying to say that before you there were many people with brilliant plans to save the world, here and elsewhere. There will be people once you're gone. And here, this is a great place for that. But you mustn't confuse this place for the real world. Even the purest ideas are husks of their former selves when they go out there, if they survive at all. And all too frequently a beautiful dream is mutated and beat into the shape of an ugly and awful thing."

"So what do I do?"

"It is your dream. You've got to be the one to bleed it. Or throw it into cryo-sleep, or -- yes cryo-sleep until the world is ready."

"Cryo-sleep?"

"I've been watching Star Trek. Netflix. It's quite good."

"See I told you. Kirk is the man, right?"

"I think I prefer Spock. He's a more interesting philosophical study, speaking of which," his grandfather checked his watch. "Oh jeez. I've got a class to teach. Philosophy and Pop Culture. Love that class. Now, Naram, before I get into all the ways Piccard is superior to Spock, we're clear on the device? The dangers?"

Naram said he was.

There was a moment in the lab when he thought about it. He had a bat in hand, just standing there in that dark room, three stories below ground, with the air smelling close but lightly tinged with electricity. The machine was humming on standby. Had he not met that lovely girl earlier, randomly in the coffee shop during its graveyard shift, he'd have done it. Smashed the device to bits. He had met her though and they talked for hours, eventually finding that they'd run out of superficial things to talk about. The intelligent, lovely little barista wanted to know, at two a.m., she wanted to know: who was Naram? So Naram began to talk about the weather. Because to listen to Naram talk about the weather was to really understand the core of the man, and to glimpse a little of what is good in humanity. At last, he talked about his potential, and his uncle, and how he was intensely, bottomlessly afraid. The barista, Lucretia but-my-friends-call-me-Lu Marion said "Where would we be if hope never triumphed over fear?" He'd never forgotten that.

### Six Years Before That
(naram's talk with his father)

Be strong. He won't understand. But he loves you. This is what Naram's mother told him before he set off for Al Salam to see his father.

When he arrived, he stood in the mouth of the hall for a moment, just observing his father at work, admiring him. Presently, Fuwaz Nazari was talking to a group of doctors, planning. Fuwaz Nazari didn't talk about his father much but he would tell Naram stories his own father had told him when he was growing up. Fuwaz Nazari had inherited a fascination with the seemingly impossible stories of his people's past. One of his favorites was that of Naram-Sin, one of the greatest conquerors to ever live. Except hardly anyone had ever heard of him. Fuwaz would tell his son "Naram-Sin was just as miraculous as Genghis Khan or Alexander The Great. But the greatness of Muslim people is inconvenient to the west and the Americans and the stories they tell. So they've erased him." Inconvenient. Fuwaz frequently spoke of The West as a grand machine, conspiring against his own people. He said it was his mission to show how great they could be. He said that should be Naram's mission too. No one alive could watch Fuwaz go about his work at the Hospital without being impressed. At work, Fuwaz was his best self. That was the man Naram wanted to remember. Naram filed the image of that great man away, before finally emerging from the hall to tell his father the news.

"I got in dad. MIT" The other doctors' eyes beamed and they patted Naram on the back and they all gave their congratulations. Fuwaz apologized and asked for a moment alone with his son.

"So that's it. You're going, I take it."

Naram ran his tongue around his teeth, maybe trying to prod his face into something else, anything other than the scowl it was converging towards. "You know, most people would be happy. Most parents. Mom was happy. She actually hugged me."

"I have never been interested in being most people. Now isn't any different. Fine. Go be with your grandfather. You two will get along well. You always have."

"This is a great opportunity for me. You always talk about showing the world how great our people can be, well here you go."

"Don't. Don't act like you care about my people. You don't even believe, Naram. Go. Go and be an American like you always wanted. And don't lie and say you're coming back." Fuwaz's eyes grew empty, as he looked away from the world around him and in on one years in the past. He chuckled.

"Is that what this is to you? Funny?" asked Naram.

"In a way. You know there's a theory of humor that says things are funny when they don't make sense. It doesn't make sense to me that you and your grandfather can't see it and it's been happening for as long as that country has been around. They claim to have this open door, freely admitting the people of the world to pursue dreams that are only possible in America. But they'll never let you in."

"Of course they will. I'll have a Student Visa."

"That's not what I mean Naram."

### Present Day

Croesus was an investment firm in the heart of Silicon Valley. Those are just the facts. If you had half a brain you knew Croesus was THE investment firm in Silicon Valley, the world really. For a while there were efforts to track the value of its fund, but eventually that became a virtually impossible task, and people settled for just saying that Croesus had more money than God. The closest historical likeness is probably the East India Trading Company, although Croesus lacked the ability to wage war.

"You're a hard man to get a meeting with Mr. Nazari," said Hiran Anthony, founder of Croesus. "I'm not used to saying that."

"I apologize. I haven't been good about keeping up with email."

"No don't apologize. Never apologize for being in a position of power. There. Just made that up." Hiran snapped his fingers. "Io could you record that for the new book?" No one responded."Io?" he asked again. "Io what're you -- " he turned around and then realized that there was no one else there. "-- that's right. I'm sorry, I'm so used to having my assistant with me." The two were situated in a windowless two story expanse that was all black and metal except for the bright orange slide traversing the two floors. There was also a cold brew coffee machine. Naram had no idea where they were within the building because in the elevator Hiran hadn't pushed a button. When the doors had closed, a voice asked which floor they were going to and Hiran replied: "Sanctum," and this was surely impossible but Naram swore the little steel chamber slid horizontally and diagonally and in four different directions before they'd arrived.

"I'm sorry and this isn't really my place or anything, but is this all necessary?" asked Naram. "I mean, we're in this secret room, and there aren't any windows. And I'm not sure but it seems like this is all soundproof. And you wouldn't even let your as -- "

" -- yes. To answer your question. Yes. This is totally necessary. See, you saying that tells me that you don't even fully understand the magnitude of what you've got on your hands. This is one of the greatest achievements in human history Naram, if you don't mind. We're talking lightbulb-automobile-level stuff, my friend. This is big. I mean, shit man, Cadillac One stopped by your casa the other day."

"H--how do you know about that?"

"Naram. C'mon man. Everyone in the Valley knows about that. It's all anyone's talking about. You've got these people praying like the sky's about to fall just to have two minutes with you. And here you are. You don't take any meetings but then the President comes to your house and she says something and then you come talk to me. Whatever she said, it was either very good or very bad."

A familiar boiling, clamminess flushed through Naram's core all the way to his toes. It was the same angry and terrified combo that hit him whenever he'd bought a car or rented an apartment or sold anything significant. It was the feeling that he was about to be taken for a ride.

"She wants the weather machine or she's kicking me out of the country." Hiran showed his teeth.

"That it? What does citizenship run these days? A couple hundred million or something? That's nothing. A shame. I didn't think she was that kind of president. Look. You sell me the device, your personal services, and whatever operation you've got attached to it and I'll take care of everything."

### Hours Earlier
The President was staring out the window of Air Force One, thoughts flowing by with the gray clouds. Her phone rang. "How'd it go babe?" It was the First Gentleman.

"Not well. I had to threaten him. I'm not -- I'm not that person."

"I know you're not going to want to hear this sweetheart, but, you're the President before you're anything else. You've got a responsibility to the American people."

"And what, he's not one of those people?"

"No, no, no. Of course he is. But he's also created something incredibly dangerous."

"It's not like that's what he's trying to do with it. Naram Nazari, maybe more than anyone else, he's trying to save us from ourselves."

"That's just it sweetie. Naram Nazari isn't the problem. Directly at least. I fully believe that when he runs that machine he's trying to help. But eliminating smog in L.A. might cause a hurricane in Florida or even Australia or South Africa. Drought in the Middle East. And then what if someone with bad intentions gets it? Weaponized tornadoes?"

The President rubbed her eyes. "We don't know that. None of us know the full extent of it's capabilities, aside from what it's been doing in Boston. That it has the potential for weaponized weather is all theory at this point, and the people pedalling it are the curmudgeons and fear mongers."

"But the possibility exists."

"You're right." She sat in silence with her husband on the other end, listening to his breath. Before she was President she would do that sometimes when she couldn't sleep; just wake up and lie there and watch and listen to him breathe. It helped her sleep for some reason. "You know that they want to use it. The Military. They think it can end war. This one. All of them."

"Maybe it can."

"But who are we?"

"Who else? If it does ever end, someone's gotta do it."

"I just don't know."

"It could be bloodless. Maybe you don't give it to the military guys. Maybe you just say to the world: "Look. We control the weather. We'll gladly fix any climate issues you're country might be having, so long as you're not involved in any fighting." Or something like that."

"Behave or else we won't stop that hurricane, the drought or the smog choking your country? The flood? And we pick the Noahs."

"Yeah. You've got a point. What's that your mom said when you told her you were running?"

"She said she hoped I would lose. She wouldn't wish the presidency on her worst enemy."

"Smart woman."

### Present Day

"And you're not going to turn it into a weapon?" asked Naram.

"What? Fuck no. We're not that kind of company. We're gonna stay true to your vision. Correcting the climate catastrophe. Saving the world."

Naram exhaled and for the first time in weeks, he laughed. "Oh my god. That's, you, you have no idea how much better I feel. I was so scared. It was...crushing me."

"I'm glad to hear that Naram. Now there's a little bit of business we'll need to work out."

"Oh. Yeah. Of course. So I'm thinking, because currently it's only small scale like a metropolis, maybe small country scale. I was thinking we could build it up and then just run it. You'd get all the credit. I mean it's the single most important environmental -- "

"-- if it works city by city, I don't know how much we need to scale actually. Country-sized maybe. But we can talk about that later. We'll run the numbers and figure out what to charge and all that."

"I'm...did you say charge?"

"Uh...yeah."

"I just...I mean I wasn't planning on ch-charging really."

"What?" laughed Hiran. "Well then...what's the point?"

"The point? Saving the world seems like enough of a 'point' to me."

"Oh. You were serious about that? I just thought that was like the company motto or something. Listen Naram, if you're not charging, I don't really see a business model and it's not looking like a great investment to me. Unless you were thinking ads or something -- but that's a dark and dangerous road so -- "

"-- I don't think I can sell you the device then Mr. Anthony."

### Early life

There were times when it would rain at Naram's grandparents' home in Lexington, and just he and his grandmother would venture outside in their rubber boots and coats and marvel at the phenomenon. A child's fascination with rain can make it new for anyone who can see that look on their face. On one particular occasion Naram's grandfather was in the kitchen cooking a recipe a colleague from Shanghai had given him. "If it rains here, is it raining in China?" asked a young Naram Nazari.

One thing Ziva Nazari never did for her grandson was water down the truth. One day you're stretching he truth so they can understand and the next you're telling them outright lies, she'd say. "Do you know what chaos is?" she asked the little boy.

"When things are all over the place and nothing makes sense?" he replied.

"Exactly. Weather is a chaotic system. A small change can produce a massive change elsewhere in the system."

Naram crossed his arms and tapped his lip with an index finger. Naram did it because it's what his grandfather did when he wrote his papers and it seemed to be what all the best thinkers did when they were unraveling a particularly knotty problem. "So..." his voice trailed off as he followed the thought a little further. "So rain here, might mean a tornado in China?"

His grandmother pulled him further under her umbrella as the rain picked up. "Perhaps. Or it might mean nothing at all."

"Well that's boring."

"Is it?" she said tapping the tip of his nose.

"Yeah. It's only cool if something big happens."

"Well one little thing will rarely lead to anything big. But a bunch of little things add up in wonderfully odd ways. That's part of chaos. It's impossible to know what little change did it. Maybe it's even wrong to say that any one thing is responsible at all." Naram's grandfather knocked on the back window that peered back into the yard. Dinner was ready. Ziva wrapped her arm around Naram's shoulders, and together they walked up the steps to the back porch.

"Grandma, is it possible to control the weather? Make it rain?"

She beamed proudly at her grandson. "Maybe one day. But just because you can make it rain, that doesn't mean you can control the weather."

### Years Later. Naram has just built the device

Everything was good and then it wasn't. On an unremarkable Tuesday, when the sky wasn't sobbing like it should've -- in hindsight -- but neither was it even *that* blue, something in the core of America snapped and nothing made sense. School buses, that day, erupted into columns of fire before they could even make it in for first bell. Husbands went to the grocery store for milk and never returned. Contrary to what they were told, students witnessed their final exams turn into life and death situations. Planes fell from the sky like the crooked paper machinations a child throws out a window, testing for distance. Churches burned. And mosques. And synagogues. At the end of what everyone wished had been a run-of-the-mill Tuesday, too many people were gone to count exactly. Everyone left pleaded with, and screamed at their televisions for it to say something they could make sense of. That never came.

Eleanor Reed, President of the United States slammed the door to the Oval. She placed her face straight down on her desk and cried. She cried for the horrific loss of lives she was sworn to protect. Yet she also cried, because an era, an era of peace, was over.

The only sensible thing left to do was to begin the search for answers. Days passed without any. The country questioned known radicals of all stripes and creeds. None of them knew much of anything. The kinds of connections to radical cells that could get you interrogated became more tangential and gossamer. Connections that sounded like the prefaces to the bad stories told over drinks at dinner. My friend's cousin's stepsister's chiropractor told my cousin's boyfriend...

Eleanor imagined a spider freely roaming over the country, without any way to guess who next might be caught in its web. When there's a spider and you've got no idea how to deal with it directly, one sensible thing to do is to take a glass jar and place it over an area, including the spider, until the spider yields or dies.

### The machine works for the first time and the mysterious man (The Spider)
"Son are you safe?" Naram was talking with his father on his way into the lab.

"Yes, dad. You're worrying too much. It's an immigration halt. She's not interning people from the Middle East or anything."

"It's a witchhunt Naram. And a witch hunt rarely ends without someone getting burned."

"It won't be me dad. I had nothing to do with it." Naram had arrived. He managed to fish his keycard out of his pocket despite the four coffees he was holding. The coffees were unruly if he used only one hand, so he ran the keycard in front of the sensor using his teeth to hold it. The system beeped approvingly and a flash of green issued from the sensor as the door to his lab slid open.

"A witch hunt doesn't end until somebody burns Naram. And that isn't necessarily the person responsible. She'll have to give them someone."

Naram rolled his eyes and meted out silent hellos to his everyone in the lab. Amongst the faces gathered there was one he didn't recognize.

"Listen dad, I think it'll be fine. I think we're passed the whole blame anyone who looks like they might be muslim phase in American politics. She's not that kind of President." He shook the new man's hand. "Li - listen, dad, just -- look I gotta go. I'll call you later if you want but I gotta go, alright? Bye." Naram's advisor, Dr. Holm, was brimming over with electricity.

"Naram, this is Hank Thompson. Writer for the Boston Globe. He wants to cover your device!" Naram looked the man over.

"No."

"No?" repeated Dr. Holm. He scurried uneasily after Naram who'd already drifted toward some task that waited on the opposite edge of the room. "No?" he whispered again into Naram's ear. He looked back at the reporter, smiled. "Are you nuts. This would be great for you. You'd be famous. Your career would...you do this and the machine works and you'd never have to worry about anything ever again."

"And if it doesn't? No, I don't want that kind of pressure and this guy just shows up out of nowhere? I don't, something about him. Just no."

Dr. Holm turned to the camera and notepad-laden reporter again, smiling a bit less intensely. "Well, it's your decision. I won't talk to him either. And I'll go and take him out of here but I just want to get my two sense in and say that I think this is a very bad idea."

"That's what you said about the machine at first too." Dr. Holm chuckled and walked back to Hank Thompson.

"And it still isn't quite working is it?" he called back, grinning. Sometimes the inconsequential words are the sharpest.

After the professor and the reporter from out of the blue were gone, Naram got up from the workbench and walked over to where Jin was busy soldering a Gordian knot of wires and circuitry. "Is this going to work?" he asked over the creschendoing chaos of sparks. Jin stopped and tilted her mask back. She looked around the lab. The dry-erasable walls were covered in arcane tomes worth of equations and dead-of-night thoughts, so much so that in some places it was difficult to see the white underneath. DQ and Isabel talked in one corner, with a lot of waving arms and erasures. Hunks of machinery lie in heaps in intervals around the center of the room where the device stood, pulsing solemnly. "It's a happy disaster," said Jin.

"That is not really what I was looking for. Gotta be honest. I feel kinda worse now actually."

"I said it was happy!" she responded with her usual effervescence.

"But also a disaster."

"Does this not look like a disaster to you?" she asked Naram, waving her soldering iron a bit carelessly, indicating the room which looked like it'd just hosted the running of the bulls.

"Sure, sure. It's a mess. But disaster? You've already lost hope."

Jin smirked as she flipped her mask down and up a few times, playfully. "No. I never had too much hope in this thing. It's crazy! I had hope in you though. Even if this thing never claws its way out of all this electro-junk to make snow in July, I'll have some fun working on this thing. I mean, how many other times am I gonna get to do something even half as straight-out-of-a-bad-science-fiction-movie as this? Now go. *I'm* actually busy trying to make this thing run." Jin clanked her mask down abruptly. "Ow. My nose." The two laughed and then Jin went back to work.

### Months Later. The Machine runs

The machine was shaking the roof. Just the four of them gathered underneath a cloud-smothered moon, DQ, Isabel, Jin, and Naram. "Should we turn it off?" DQ screamed over the din. He peered down through the roof-hatch into the lab. A pale, blue, ghostly light painted his face like he was glaring straight into the mouth of the underworld and some world-eating monstrosity was trying to claw its way across the breach. Isabel stared at the screen of the clunky controller attached to the main body of the machine via a thick bundle of wires.

"Readings are normal," she said.

"Well they're usually pretty bad so..." quipped Jin.

"I don't know guys," replied DQ. "It's...thrashing."

Naram wasn't really listening. He couldn't take his eyes off the sky. "Maybe it needs more power," he said quietly for no one but himself.

"You're not," Jin started, but Naram brushed passed her and Isabel and DQ and descended into the lab. The machine had etched out a place for itself in the refuse surrounding it. Seeing the way it was wobbling off-kilter in this ever more eccentric and doomed orbit, it reminded Naram of the time his grandparents' washing machine had been on the verge of catastrophic failure and in the process of the collapse had done quite a number on the basement. He shrugged it off. The machine was going to make it snow whether it was on board or not, and if it insisted on taking ninety-percent of the lab with it then so be it. There was, however, an immediate setback.

Every outlet in the lab was connected one way or another to the machine.

"So...what's up?" Naram turned and there was Jin, just touching down from the roof.

"I'm stuck."

"Here? On this? No, no, no, no, no. What's the issue?"

Naram extended his arms. "Do you see any outlets? Or, for that matter, and cords that might be able to run out here and down to the physics lab?"

Jin blew a raspberry into the air. "As usual Mr. Nazari you've latched onto the wrong problem."

A handful of minutes later they were in one of the staff parking lots.

"You're crazy," said Naram, both hands clasping his head as, within its walls, he tried to figure if he had any shot at not spending the night in a cell.

"You're being dramatic. We're *borrowing* it." Jin was saying this as she hefted the battery out of some anonymous professor's car.

"That's a charitable definition of what we're doing right now. If I were an entirely neutral party I might say that we are pilfering -- "

"-- nice SAT word Naz -- "

"-- thank you, but I might say something closer to the truth which is that we're pilfering a car battery and then stealing away in the dead of night, for probably nefarious ends. Point is, it doesn't look good. Most people would say we ought to be thrown in jail."

"Most people are building a weather machine," she said finally.

Back at the lab, they shut off the machine and connected their ill-gotten battery. Naram signaled Isabel to activate the device. It jerked to life, as if defibrillated, and the light grew so pupil-dillatingly bright and hot that they each threw up their hands to shield their eyes. And then it shut off. When they opened their it was so dark, it  was like they'd been dropped in a vat of ink.

"It was a good run Naram," said Isabel.

Jin scoffed. "Well we could at least go check for fuck's sake!" she said, climbing up through the hatch in the ceiling. The others followed, except for Naram. Somehow it was better to just not see. His heart was so low then, just staring at the coffee-speckled carpet. They weren't saying anything though. He looked up and felt a flicker in his chest. The moon, so brilliant before, was barely visible behind a deep veil of cloudy sky. Furthermore, goosebumps burrowed up on his skin, as frigid air sunk down through the hatch.

And then it began to snow.

With the falling of each and every new flake Naram gained a bit more belief that this was really his dream, finally congealing into reality. He grasped the rung of the ladder to the roof dreamily. For a moment he forgot exactly how one goes about climbing a ladder, and clumsily strutted upwards. Out on the roof, he felt unrooted in time and tossed into an era that had never existed. People out on the streets stared up in their shirts and shorts and skirts, in awe. Jin slipped her hand into his, and stared up at the sky as well. It was Naram's bad happen to exit from moments like that one, and make some attempt to preserve it forever, rend it into the most impenetrable corners of himself. Naram couldn't recall even an instant when he had ever been happier. He kissed Jin's hand.

That was the last time he saw Jin.

(because she, as an immigrant, gets effected by the legislation the government is developing)

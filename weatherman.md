## The Weatherman
--
Long ago, there was a wizard.
--
"Hon, you're going to want to get up."

"Hon, I very much do NOT want to get up right now. Please...what time is -- it's not even six. At least give me another hour."

"Hon, trust me. Someone's here and they want to speak with you."

"Lulu, they can wait. They can have some common decency. You don't wake a man to talk before six in the morning. Unless someone's dead, or there's a baby being born -- "

"-- or you're the President of The United States."

Five minutes later and Naram Sin Nazari had just finished brushing his teeth. There was no time to shave. "At least you won't have morning breath," said Lulu at the top of the stairs, giving Naram a kiss, trying to wake him up. "And some women love a little stubble." She grinned at her husband before taking a grim look down the steps.

"Great pep-talk Lu," he said.

"You'll be fine."

 He sat down at the table in the kitchen. It was the first furniture his wife ever designed, where he had breakfast every day. And just like every other day, opposite him at the table was a woman. Every day he admired the woman across from him. Every day he maintained a healthy fear of the woman there as well, believing that to be the bedrock of any good marriage. But every day that woman was his wife and not the Leader of The Free World.

"Good morning Mr. Nazari."

"Morning, ma'am. I mean, Miss, uh, Ms. President."

"Misses, actually, I am married."

"I'm sorry, I just, I'm -- "

"-- I'm only playing," she said, chuckling and drawing a laugh from the behemoth behind her. Looking terrifying and being more massive than any human should must be a prerequisite for being in the Secret Service, thought Naram. Naram gave a queasy grin, took a sip of his coffee, burned his tongue. Jokes are never good in these situations. They always make jokes right before asking you to do something terrible. "In all seriousness Mr. Nazari, I am here on pretty pressing business. I have to ask you to do something. You might find it distasteful at first, but realize that I'm asking you to do this as a service to the country that has become your adopted home."

"Wha-what are you asking? Ex-exactly?"

"The machine. The weather-machine, the...," she looked down at the files in front of her, "the Agi 1."

"...yes?"

"I need you to turn the device over to the US Government."

 In his new, caffeine-alert state, Naram saw the colossus' clench his jaw, overgrown muscles even there bulging. Naram didn't slam his mug down like he had a right to. He just eased it down to the table at about the pace of dripping honey, making sure his hands were incredibly visible the entire time.

"No."

"Interesting," said the President.

"How's that?"

"No, I was just, I was very clear with the phrasing. I practiced it in the car. I was very careful about not making it sound like a question."

"It's mine. You can't."

"You're right. You're a smart man and I bet you know your way around some small print. Can't make you do a thing. I can't, for example, have this man behind me shoot you and then seize the device. The device is sitting somewhere in a hidden lab in Cambridge as I understand, so that wouldn't be too prudent on my part, for one. More importantly, that would be entirely un-American. And you and me, we value American ideals, don't we?"

"Certainly."

"American ideals are about half the reason you came over, that and MIT, am I right? You do like America, living here?" Naram felt his stomach collapsing in on itself like a star in its last gasps of breath.

"Of course."

"I can make it so that you can never set foot in this country again. And maybe I'd make it so you're wife couldn't leave on top of that. Patriotism is sometimes an inconvenient ideal, but it's among the most important. Fundamental. Patriots serve their country. And call me crazy, but if you're going to insist on being so un-American, you can leave." She stood up from the table, gathered her files. "The device will be in the hands of the Government, when everything is said and done. I know this looks bad Naram. A lot of gloom and doom language and then you made me threaten you. I'm not some -- some supervillain, Naram. It's just for the best if the device is in the hands of the government, where we can keep it safe, and make sure it's not put to any other use than making the world a better place. You'll be a hero. I'll make sure of that." She put her hand on his shoulder. It was cold. "I'll be in touch."

### Two Years Earlier

"A weapon?" said Niram. "No, jiddo. I'm a hippie. A total and complete pacifist. I literally just want to save the planet."

"Bureauocrats think everything is a weapon Naram. Nuclear power?"

"That's different."

"Not where it matters. Look around you." Naram and his grandfather stared at the MIT Campus, dusted finely and completely with a spritz of snow. "This is a utopia. Haunted by brilliant ghosts, like yourself. Unable to resist the pull of a place where they could build those things that had formerly only wandered around the larger than average confines of their own heads."

"Jiddo that's not true. Phrenology has pretty much had all of it's credibility remo --"

"-- not the point Naram. I'm trying to say that before you there were many people with brilliant plans to save the world, here and elsewhere. There will be people once you're gone. And here, this is a great place for that. But you mustn't confuse this place for the real world. Even the purest ideas are husks of their former selves when they go out there, if they survive at all. And all too frequently a beautiful dream is mutated and beat into the shape of an ugly and awful thing."

"So what do I do?"

"It is your dream. You've got to be the one to bleed it. Or throw it into cryo-sleep, or -- yes cryo-sleep until the world is ready."

"Cryo-sleep?"

"I've been watching Star Trek. Netflix. It's quite good."

"See I told you. Kirk is the man, right?"

"I think I prefer Spock. He's a more interesting philosophical study, speaking of which," his grandfather checked his watch. "Oh jeez. I've got a class to teach. Philosophy and Pop Culture. Love that class. Now, Naram, before I get into all the ways Piccard is superior to Spock, we're clear on the device? The dangers?"

Naram said he was.

There was a moment in the lab when he thought about it. He had a bat in hand, just standing there in that dark room, three stories below ground, with the air smelling close but lightly tinged with electricity. The machine was humming on standby. Had he not met that lovely girl earlier, randomly in the coffee shop during its graveyard shift, he'd have done it. Smashed the device to bits. He had met her though and they talked for hours, eventually finding that they'd run out of superficial things to talk about. The intelligent, lovely little barista wanted to know, at two a.m., she wanted to know: who was Naram? So Naram began to talk about the weather. Because to listen to Naram talk about the weather was to really understand the core of the man, and to glimpse a little of what is good in humanity. At last, he talked about his potential, and his uncle, and how he was intensely, bottomlessly afraid. The barista, Lucretia but-my-friends-call-me-Lu Marion said "Where would we be if hope never triumphed over fear?" He'd never forgotten that.

### Six Years Before That
(naram's talk with his father)

Be strong. He won't understand. But he loves you. This is what Naram's mother told him before he set off for Al Salam to see his father.

When he arrived, he stood in the mouth of the hall for a moment, just observing his father at work, admiring him. Presently, Fuwaz Nazari was talking to a group of doctors, planning. Fuwaz Nazari didn't talk about his father much but he would tell Naram stories his own father had told him when he was growing up. Fuwaz Nazari had inherited a fascination with the seemingly impossible stories of his people's past. One of his favorites was that of Naram-Sin, one of the greatest conquerors to ever live. Except hardly anyone had ever heard of him. Fuwaz would tell his son "Naram-Sin was just as miraculous as Genghis Khan or Alexander The Great. But the greatness of Muslim people is inconvenient to the west and the Americans and the stories they tell. So they've erased him." Inconvenient. Fuwaz frequently spoke of The West as a grand machine, conspiring against his own people. He said it was his mission to show how great they could be. He said that should be Naram's mission too. No one alive could watch Fuwaz go about his work at the Hospital without being impressed. At work, Fuwaz was his best self. That was the man Naram wanted to remember. Naram filed the image of that great man away, before finally emerging from the hall to tell his father the news.

"I got in dad. MIT" The other doctors' eyes beamed and they patted Naram on the back and they all gave their congratulations. Fuwaz apologized and asked for a moment alone with his son.

"So that's it. You're going, I take it."

Naram ran his tongue around his teeth, maybe trying to prod his face into something else, anything other than the scowl it was converging towards. "You know, most people would be happy. Most parents. Mom was happy. She actually hugged me."

"I have never been interested in being most people. Now isn't any different. Fine. Go be with your grandfather. You two will get along well. You always have."

"This is a great opportunity for me. You always talk about showing the world how great our people can be, well here you go."

"Don't. Don't act like you care about my people. You don't even believe, Naram. Go. Go and be an American like you always wanted. And don't lie and say you're coming back." Fuwaz's eyes grew empty, as he looked away from the world around him and in on one years in the past. He chuckled.

"Is that what this is to you? Funny?" asked Naram.

"In a way. You know there's a theory of humor that says things are funny when they don't make sense. It doesn't make sense to me that you and your grandfather can't see it and it's been happening for as long as that country has been around. They claim to have this open door, freely admitting the people of the world to pursue dreams that are only possible in America. But they'll never let you in."

"Of course they will. I'll have a Student Visa."

"That's not what I mean Naram."

### Present Day

Croesus was an investment firm in the heart of Silicon Valley. Those are just the facts. If you had half a brain you knew Croesus was THE investment firm in Silicon Valley, the world really. For a while there were efforts to track the value of its fund, but eventually that became a virtually impossible task, and people settled for just saying that Croesus had more money than God. The closest historical likeness is probably the East India Trading Company, although Croesus lacked the ability to wage war.

"You're a hard man to get a meeting with Mr. Nazari," said Hiran Anthony, founder of Croesus. "I'm not used to saying that."

"I apologize. I haven't been good about keeping up with email."

"No don't apologize. Never apologize for being in a position of power. There. Just made that up." Hiran snapped his fingers. "Io could you record that for the new book?" No one responded."Io?" he asked again. "Io what're you -- " he turned around and then realized that there was no one else there. "-- that's right. I'm sorry, I'm so used to having my assistant with me." The two were situated in a windowless two story expanse that was all black and metal except for the bright orange slide traversing the two floors. There was also a cold brew coffee machine. Naram had no idea where they were within the building because in the elevator Hiran hadn't pushed a button. When the doors had closed, a voice asked which floor they were going to and Hiran replied: "Sanctum," and this was surely impossible but Naram swore the little steel chamber slid horizontally and diagonally and in four different directions before they'd arrived.

"I'm sorry and this isn't really my place or anything, but is this all necessary?" asked Naram. "I mean, we're in this secret room, and there aren't any windows. And I'm not sure but it seems like this is all soundproof. And you wouldn't even let your as -- "

" -- yes. To answer your question. Yes. This is totally necessary. See, you saying that tells me that you don't even fully understand the magnitude of what you've got on your hands. This is one of the greatest achievements in human history Naram, if you don't mind. We're talking lightbulb-automobile-level stuff, my friend. This is big. I mean, shit man, Cadillac One stopped by your casa the other day."

"H--how do you know about that?"

"Naram. C'mon man. Everyone in the Valley knows about that. It's all anyone's talking about. You've got these people praying like the sky's about to fall just to have two minutes with you. And here you are. You don't take any meetings but then the President comes to your house and she says something and then you come talk to me. Whatever she said, it was either very good or very bad."

A familiar boiling, clamminess flushed through Naram's core all the way to his toes. It was the same angry and terrified combo that hit him whenever he'd bought a car or rented an apartment or sold anything significant. It was the feeling that he was about to be taken for a ride.

"She wants the weather machine or she's kicking me out of the country." Hiran showed his teeth.

"That it? What does citizenship run these days? A couple hundred million or something? That's nothing. A shame. I didn't think she was that kind of president. Look. You sell me the device, your personal services, and whatever operation you've got attached to it and I'll take care of everything."

### Hours Earlier
The President was staring out the window of Air Force One, thoughts flowing by with the gray clouds. Her phone rang. "How'd it go babe?" It was the First Gentleman.

"Not well. I had to threaten him. I'm not -- I'm not that person."

"I know you're not going to want to hear this sweetheart, but, you're the President before you're anything else. You've got a responsibility to the American people."

"And what, he's not one of those people?"

"No, no, no. Of course he is. But he's also created something incredibly dangerous."

"It's not like that's what he's trying to do with it. Naram Nazari, maybe more than anyone else, he's trying to save us from ourselves."

"That's just it sweetie. Naram Nazari isn't the problem. Directly at least. I fully believe that when he runs that machine he's trying to help. But eliminating smog in L.A. might cause a hurricane in Florida or even Australia or South Africa. Drought in the Middle East. And then what if someone with bad intentions gets it? Weaponized tornadoes?"

The President rubbed her eyes. "We don't know that. None of us know the full extent of it's capabilities, aside from what it's been doing in Boston. That it has the potential for weaponized weather is all theory at this point, and the people pedalling it are the curmudgeons and fear mongers."

"But the possibility exists."

"You're right." She sat in silence with her husband on the other end, listening to his breath. Before she was President she would do that sometimes when she couldn't sleep; just wake up and lie there and watch and listen to him breathe. It helped her sleep for some reason. "You know that they want to use it. The Military. They think it can end war. This one. All of them."

"Maybe it can."

"But who are we?"

"Who else? If it does ever end, someone's gotta do it."

"I just don't know."

"It could be bloodless. Maybe you don't give it to the military guys. Maybe you just say to the world: "Look. We control the weather. We'll gladly fix any climate issues you're country might be having, so long as you're not involved in any fighting." Or something like that."

"Behave or else we won't stop that hurricane, the drought or the smog choking your country? The flood? And we pick the Noahs."

"Yeah. You've got a point. What's that your mom said when you told her you were running?"

"She said she hoped I would lose. She wouldn't wish the presidency on her worst enemy."

"Smart woman."

### Present Day

"And you're not going to turn it into a weapon?" asked Naram.

"What? Fuck no. We're not that kind of company. We're gonna stay true to your vision. Correcting the climate catastrophe. Saving the world."

Naram exhaled and for the first time in weeks, he laughed. "Oh my god. That's, you, you have no idea how much better I feel. I was so scared. It was...crushing me."

"I'm glad to hear that Naram. Now there's a little bit of business we'll need to work out."

"Oh. Yeah. Of course. So I'm thinking, because currently it's only small scale like a metropolis, maybe small country scale. I was thinking we could build it up and then just run it. You'd get all the credit. I mean it's the single most important environmental -- "

"-- if it works city by city, I don't know how much we need to scale actually. Country-sized maybe. But we can talk about that later. We'll run the numbers and figure out what to charge and all that."

"I'm...did you say charge?"

"Uh...yeah."

"I just...I mean I wasn't planning on ch-charging really."

"What?" laughed Hiran. "Well then...what's the point?"

"The point? Saving the world seems like enough of a 'point' to me."

"Oh. You were serious about that? I just thought that was like the company motto or something. Listen Naram, if you're not charging, I don't really see a business model and it's not looking like a great investment to me. Unless you were thinking ads or something -- but that's a dark and dangerous road so -- "

"-- I don't think I can sell you the device then Mr. Anthony."

### Early life

There were times when it would rain at Naram's grandparents' home in Lexington, and just he and his grandmother would venture outside in their rubber boots and coats and marvel at the phenomenon. A child's fascination with rain can make it new for anyone who can see that look on their face. On one particular occasion Naram's grandfather was in the kitchen cooking a recipe a colleague from Shanghai had given him. "If it rains here, is it raining in China?" asked a young Naram Nazari.

One thing Ziva Nazari never did for her grandson was water down the truth. One day you're stretching he truth so they can understand and the next you're telling them outright lies, she'd say. "Do you know what chaos is?" she asked the little boy.

"When things are all over the place and nothing makes sense?" he replied.

"Exactly. Weather is a chaotic system. A small change can produce a massive change elsewhere in the system."

Naram crossed his arms and tapped his lip with an index finger. Naram did it because it's what his grandfather did when he wrote his papers and it seemed to be what all the best thinkers did when they were unraveling a particularly knotty problem. "So..." his voice trailed off as he followed the thought a little further. "So rain here, might mean a tornado in China?"

His grandmother pulled him further under her umbrella as the rain picked up. "Perhaps. Or it might mean nothing at all."

"Well that's boring."

"Is it?" she said tapping the tip of his nose.

"Yeah. It's only cool if something big happens."

"Well one little thing will rarely lead to anything big. But a bunch of little things add up in wonderfully odd ways. That's part of chaos. It's impossible to know what little change did it. Maybe it's even wrong to say that any one thing is responsible at all." Naram's grandfather knocked on the back window that peered back into the yard. Dinner was ready. Ziva wrapped her arm around Naram's shoulders, and together they walked up the steps to the back porch.

"Grandma, is it possible to control the weather? Make it rain?"

She beamed proudly at her grandson. "Maybe one day. But just because you can make it rain, that doesn't mean you can control the weather."

### The machine works for the first time and the mysterious man (The Spider)
Naram had arrived. He managed to fish his keycard out of his pocket despite the four coffees he was holding. The coffees were unruly if he used only one hand, so he ran the keycard in front of the sensor using his teeth to hold it. The system beeped approvingly and a flash of green issued from the sensor as the door to his lab slid open.

Amongst the faces gathered there was one he didn't recognize.

Naram's advisor, Dr. Holm, was brimming over with electricity.

"Naram, this is Hank Thompson. Writer for the Boston Globe. He wants to cover your device!" Naram looked the man over.

"No."

"No?" repeated Dr. Holm. He scurried uneasily after Naram who'd already drifted toward some task that waited on the opposite edge of the room. "No?" he whispered again into Naram's ear. He looked back at the reporter, smiled. "Are you nuts. This would be great for you. You'd be famous. Your career would...you do this and the machine works and you'd never have to worry about anything ever again."

"And if it doesn't? No, I don't want that kind of pressure and this guy just shows up out of nowhere? I don't, something about him. Just no."

Dr. Holm turned to the camera and notepad-laden reporter again, smiling a bit less intensely. "Well, it's your decision. I won't talk to him either. And I'll go and take him out of here but I just want to get my two sense in and say that I think this is a very bad idea."

"That's what you said about the machine at first too." Dr. Holm chuckled and walked back to Hank Thompson.

"And it still isn't quite working is it?" he called back, grinning. Sometimes the inconsequential words are the sharpest.

After the professor and the reporter from out of the blue were gone, Naram got up from the workbench and walked over to where Jin was busy soldering a Gordian knot of wires and circuitry. "Is this going to work?" he asked over the creschendoing chaos of sparks. Jin stopped and tilted her mask back. She looked around the lab. The dry-erasable walls were covered in arcane tomes worth of equations and dead-of-night thoughts, so much so that in some places it was difficult to see the white underneath. DQ and Isabel talked in one corner, with a lot of waving arms and erasures. Hunks of machinery lie in heaps in intervals around the center of the room where the device stood, pulsing solemnly. "It's a happy disaster," said Jin.

"That is not really what I was looking for. Gotta be honest. I feel kinda worse now actually."

"I said it was happy!" she responded with her usual effervescence.

"But also a disaster."

"Does this not look like a disaster to you?" she asked Naram, waving her soldering iron a bit carelessly, indicating the room which looked like it'd just hosted the running of the bulls.

"Sure, sure. It's a mess. But disaster? You've already lost hope."

Jin smirked as she flipped her mask down and up a few times, playfully. "No. I never had too much hope in this thing. It's crazy! I had hope in you though. Even if this thing never claws its way out of all this electro-junk to make snow in July, I'll have some fun working on this thing. I mean, how many other times am I gonna get to do something even half as straight-out-of-a-bad-science-fiction-movie as this? Now go. *I'm* actually busy trying to make this thing run." Jin clanked her mask down abruptly. "Ow. My nose." The two laughed and then Jin went back to work.

### Months Later. The Machine runs

The machine was shaking the roof. Just the four of them gathered underneath a cloud-smothered moon, DQ, Isabel, Jin, and Naram. "Should we turn it off?" DQ screamed over the din. He peered down through the roof-hatch into the lab. A pale, blue, ghostly light painted his face like he was glaring straight into the mouth of the underworld and some world-eating monstrosity was trying to claw its way across the breach. Isabel stared at the screen of the clunky controller attached to the main body of the machine via a thick bundle of wires.

"Readings are normal," she said.

"Well they're usually pretty bad so..." quipped Jin.

"I don't know guys," replied DQ. "It's...thrashing."

Naram wasn't really listening. He couldn't take his eyes off the sky. "Maybe it needs more power," he said quietly for no one but himself.

"You're not," Jin started, but Naram brushed passed her and Isabel and DQ and descended into the lab. The machine had etched out a place for itself in the refuse surrounding it. Seeing the way it was wobbling off-kilter in this ever more eccentric and doomed orbit, it reminded Naram of the time his grandparents' washing machine had been on the verge of catastrophic failure and in the process of the collapse had done quite a number on the basement. He shrugged it off. The machine was going to make it snow whether it was on board or not, and if it insisted on taking ninety-percent of the lab with it then so be it. There was, however, an immediate setback.

Every outlet in the lab was connected one way or another to the machine.

"So...what's up?" Naram turned and there was Jin, just touching down from the roof.

"I'm stuck."

"Here? On this? No, no, no, no, no. What's the issue?"

Naram extended his arms. "Do you see any outlets? Or, for that matter, and cords that might be able to run out here and down to the physics lab?"

Jin blew a raspberry into the air. "As usual Mr. Nazari you've latched onto the wrong problem."

A handful of minutes later they were in one of the staff parking lots.

"You're crazy," said Naram, both hands clasping his head as, within its walls, he tried to figure if he had any shot at not spending the night in a cell.

"You're being dramatic. We're *borrowing* it." Jin was saying this as she hefted the battery out of some anonymous professor's car.

"That's a charitable definition of what we're doing right now. If I were an entirely neutral party I might say that we are pilfering -- "

"-- nice SAT word Naz -- "

"-- thank you, but I might say something closer to the truth which is that we're pilfering a car battery and then stealing away in the dead of night, for probably nefarious ends. Point is, it doesn't look good. Most people would say we ought to be thrown in jail."

"Most people aren't building a weather machine," she said finally.

Back at the lab, they shut off the machine and connected their ill-gotten battery. Naram signaled Isabel to activate the device. It jerked to life, as if defibrillated, and the light grew so pupil-dillatingly bright and hot that they each threw up their hands to shield their eyes. And then it shut off. When they opened their it was so dark, it  was like they'd been dropped in a vat of ink.

"It was a good run Naram," said Isabel.

Jin scoffed. "Well we could at least go check for fuck's sake!" she said, climbing up through the hatch in the ceiling. The others followed, except for Naram. Somehow it was better to just not see. His heart was so low then, just staring at the coffee-speckled carpet. They weren't saying anything though. He looked up and felt a flicker in his chest. The moon, so brilliant before, was barely visible behind a deep veil of cloudy sky. Furthermore, goosebumps burrowed up on his skin, as frigid air sunk down through the hatch.

And then it began to snow.

With the falling of each and every new flake Naram gained a bit more belief that this was really his dream, finally congealing into reality. He grasped the rung of the ladder to the roof dreamily. For a moment he forgot exactly how one goes about climbing a ladder, and clumsily strutted upwards. Out on the roof, he felt unrooted in time and tossed into an era that had never existed. People out on the streets stared up in their shirts and shorts and skirts, in awe. Jin slipped her hand into his, and stared up at the sky as well. It was Naram's bad habit to exit from moments like that one, and make some attempt to preserve it forever, rend it into the most impenetrable corners of himself. Naram couldn't recall even an instant when he had ever been happier.

### Knocking at the Golden Door

There's a harpist on retainer at Frank and Fox. Steve Frank's restaurant in New York where excess is always on the menu. A joke of Steve's. He also had joked that even if that bothers you, after a drink and succumbing to the seduction of his contractually obligated harpist, you won't care. There aren't any prices on the menu, since the assumption is that money is no object.

Steve was quite full after finishing half his gargantuan steak. Naram hadn't eaten anything since he'd lost his appetite just about six hours earlier when, on live television during his show, Steve denounced Naram as a traitor in front of a panel of government leaders.

"Do you think the name kind of sounds like Frankenfox?", started Steve. "Like some undead, pieced-together, vulpine horror? I don't know I've just been thinking about it lately and it's been -- "

"-- bothering you? Maybe like it bothered me when you said I was the kind of immigrant that you might be *for* deporting."

"Oh come on Naram. It's TV."

"Oh so it doesn't matter? I should be okay with you insinuating I'm a terrorist?"

"You're getting butthurt over nothing. Obviously I don't really think you're a terrorist. It's what the people want to hear. You have to give it to them. I'm not going to disagree with the President. She's one of us."

"That's it? That's as far as speaking truth to power goes for you?"

"What do you want Naram? Me to say the kinds of things I'd have said in college? Guess what: that's not exactly good television. And what for? Look around. You see how good things are. How they've improved since we were just kids in college, running our mouths for anyone who'd listen. Things aren't perfect but for the most part things in the world are good Naram. Except for the floods and the storms. But you're fixing that."

"The world is burning."

Steve leaned forward into the wilted light of the candle on the table. "Let it. Fuck 'em is what I say. A healthy America is good for the world and we didn't get to where we are now by helping everyone that came knocking. We'll help eventually, obviously. We'll do what we can in the meantime. But you don't mess with a good thing."

"Fuck 'em? I'm one of *them* Steve."

Steve Frank scoffed and paused to take a large gulp of his wine, paired with his meal via a world-renowned somelier, also on retainer. "You're not. You're practically American." Naram stared across the table looking for his friend, who seemed nowhere to be found. Naram stood from the table.

"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door,” Naram recited. "Enjoy the music."


### Chasing Ghosts (I think this is the end)

(maybe there should be something there, but these are the old machines)
The squadron stormed the building, rushed in, threw open the doors...and there it was. It looked a bit like an alien moon, a hundred foot sphere fraught with buzzing and blinking electrical components, the entire surface composed of honey comb divots, deep like impact craters. Just to stand in the same room with the device was to have a more complete understanding of its sheer power. An inaudible wave issued forth from the core of the thing every few seconds. One couldn't see it but one could feel it in the hardware of their chest, and from there it would resonate outward through the extremities, ultimately leaving one slightly off-kilter for a microsecond or two.

Eleanor exhaled shakily. Could this be happening? It seemed too simple. The nightmare was contained, the spider, now situated in plain sight underneath the jar. She walked outside. The sky was writhing. Where sun had bathed everything, there was now an unassailable veil of melancholy gray. The winds and the tumult ceased for a second or two, all sound sucked out of the world by some cosmic vacuum. And then it began to rain. It didn't stop.

### Project Witch Doctor
(Naram built the machine, with the help of DQ and Jin, thinking he was doing it in secret (with the stolen blueprints) but Idris found out and now she's trying to keep them all safe)

"Hurry up Franklin. I've got five minutes." Franklin was close to the floor, vertically challenged, no more than a couple inches over five feet. He was also roundish, and clumsy, and still nervous around the President. It was only a couple of weeks into the administration, to be fair. Nevertheless, he tripped over his feet to her desk, and across it he slid a file, stuffed to the height of turkey club where the sandwich-maker has been incredibly withholding. Eleanor Galloway looked at the urgently red stamped title and scoffed.

"You're not serious."

"Not normally. But there have been...developments."

Eleanor's eyes almost rolled themselves. "Fine." She flipped through the pages. First, she was angry at having her time wasted. When she turned the last photograph over, she was confused. "Is it possible?"

"Short answer: maybe. The Canadians certainly think so."

"The Canadians? But...them?" A staffer came to the door.

"Mrs. President, CNN is here for the Refugee Piece."

"Yeah, it'll just be a minute," said Eleanor.

Franklin started up again. "Our people picked up some disturbing communications. And it's crazy given how New Agey and frankly strange that era in our defense program was but..well they specifically used the phrase 'weather modification device'."

"...modification? Jesus."

"My thoughts exactly. They don't know we know. The crux of the intercepted communication is really that the PM has sent a couple of agents out to find and retrieve something called Project Witchdoctor. Now we don't know what it is exactly, but it has something to do with modified weather and it was serious enough for them to not want to tell us so the worst guess is that it's some kind of weather weapon or somesuch."

"The Canadians?" Eleanor was having particular difficulty stomaching that detail. "Jesus. What about our pact to tell each other about that stuff, huh?"

"They must not care."

"What about NATO?"

"Same."

"Well follow their agents and let's see what happens. Fuck. The Canadians?" Eleanor got up from her desk and walked to the door just as the staffer returned. Franklin left behind her.

- The Canadians don't actually know if Idris Klein has anything, but when they show up, there's this massive overreaction she's got, prompting things to quickly spiral out of control

### Thesis Defense

Naram-Sin Nazari - Naz for short but he really just liked to be called Naram - Naram was walking home from a bar, happily drunk. He'd just earned his master's degree, in Meteorological Adaptation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It had been long nights and hours of research and planning. But it had also been a lot of fun. His head was too foggy to dredge up each fond memory individually, but he could recall a wash of smiling faces and shenanigans he probably couldn't have gotten into had he stayed home, in Kuwait City. And now he was going back. To sell air conditioners. More on that later.

Naram fumbled around with the key to his apartment, managing to get the door to open finally on the fifth try. His apartment was like a crypt. Impossibly black, unnervingly quiet, and tinged by the faint odor of decay. Vladimir hadn't taken out his garbage before he left. Naram chuckled. The Russian had been a terrible roommate from the very first day.

Even in the absolute dark, Naram could sense that something about that main room had changed since he'd left. He felt like he wasn't alone. His heart began to pound. "Hello!" he called out into the black apartment. Nothing. He ran his hand over the wall next to the door for the light switch and as soon as his finger hit the knobbly protrusion of plastic, he flipped it.

The something that had changed was a box, just shorter than he was, but maybe three times wider, situated a foot to the left of the true center of the living room. Scrawled on the side in black permanent marker were the words: Project Witchdoctor. He recognized the handwriting as that of his thesis advisor, Idris Klein, probably the world's foremost expert in the esoteric and shunned field of Meteorological Adaptation. His phone rang just then, and sure enough, it was Idris.

Naram felt sick. (jump?)

"Hello?" he said into the phone.

"Oh come on Naram, you know it's me, no need for the hellos and all that. Are you drunk? Well, I should ask more precisely, how drunk are you?"

Naram tossed his jacket on the ground. "Seven on a ten point."

The voice on the other end halted. "Not great. Please start drinking some water or jogging around in place or something. I'll need you sober. That said, one benefit of your present lack of sobriety is that you'll probably not be too terribly upset with me when I tell you that I've decided not to accept the defense of your thesis. Presently. I will, but first there's a kind of *quid pro quo* scenario."

"You're not serious."

"Terribly. Fatally so even. I need you to take what's in this box somewhere. I'd explain more but I can't. I doubt they're listening in but you know, never underestimate your enemies and all that."

The room took on a distinctly, Salvador-Dalian quality, which is to say that everything seemed to melt and twirl in flagrant violation of the nature of reality, and Naram rushed into the bathroom and threw up into the toilet. To his dismay this is also when he discovered that frequently absent-minded Vladimir had also neglected to flush. Naram ripped a towel from the cabinet and wiped his face vigorously. "Who?" he asked.

"The Feds!"

"What! Holy shit. FBI?"

"No."

"CIA?"

"No. CSI."

Naram walked back to the box. "What, like the show? What're you talking about?"

"Canadian Security Intelligence. Service. So CSIS I guess."

"Wait, hold on. The Canadians?"

"Look I can't really get into it now. All I can say is there's more info in the box. It'll tell you how to find me. Tell no one. Don't talk to anyone, but especially don't talk to anyone you suspect might be even slightly Canadian."

"Look, I'm still confused, and I'm not sure I -- "

"-- there's a moving van out back. I left it in your lot. I wouldn't have involved you if there was more time, but there isn't. You should leave within the hour." Idris hung up. Naram stared at the box and wondered how he was going to get this thing down four flights of stairs.

### Confederates

There was loud knocking on the door, whilst Naram attempted to clean up the variously sticky and wet situation in the bathroom. His heart leaped against the walls of his chest. In his panic he automatically reached for a weapon. As he headed to the door he noticed that he had grabbed the plunger.

"Who is it?" he called shakily. He flipped the plunger over, so the rubber end was pointing up. At the very least, he figured, if this was a small Quebecois hit squad, he might be able to incapacitate the first one via a plunger to the face, and then the rest of them would be so caught up puzzling over the sheer absurdity of what had just happened that he just might be able to sneak through and make a break for it. He didn't actually like the plan, but he was more reluctantly committed to it with every step.

"Naram just open the door please." It was Jin. It *sounded* like Jin. But how could he know? He was, after all, in a pretty unprecendented situation and there was no telling how skilled the Canadians actually were since he'd never heard of the CSIS. Who's to say it wasn't a recording, or some device that enabled them to say anything they wanted and sound exactly like Jin? He'd seen that in a movie once. He opened the door but not all the way, just enough for him to see out into the hall with one eye.

"Yes?"

"Seriously?" It was indeed Jin. With a suitcase. And also DQ.

"What're you doing here?" he asked, opening the door, and then rushing passed them into the room, so he could awkwardly put himself between them and the box.

"Yeah. We know about the box Naram," said Jin. DQ had nothing but a backpack and she tossed that onto the ground before diving onto the already ailing futon. The futon groaned as she touched down.

"I thought you were going back to Shanghai." said Naram to Jin.

"I was. *Am*. But then...this. She called us both." DQ waved from the futon.

"Yeah. So, you weren't gonna say bye? I mean, you knew I'd be over at The Spot. You coulda, I mean, I was waiting for -- "

Jin's eyes veered off to a corner of the ceiling. " -- I know. I was going to, there's just...it's a lot. I've been thinking about a lot of things and...I wasn't sure if...I don't even know if we -- "

DQ flipped over on the futon and exhaled loudly. " -- Oh my god. Just date already."

"Shut up," said Jin, casting an incendiary glare in DQ's direction.

"Well," said DQ, "as much as this is really turning out to be one of the better episodes in this little Soap Opera of yours, I'm of the opinion that we should get this thing in the van and get on the road."

### A Cold Day in July

(the flashback should be about a specific incident)

DQ was driving. Jin was sitting in the passenger seat. Naram was trying to sleep it off. He fell asleep almost as soon as DQ pulled off the lot. The last piece of the real world that he took with him into his dreams was the constant buzz of the engine, which morphed, layers of sleep down, into the sound that filled his entire childhood. The Air Conditioner.

"Sick of the heat? Come to Fuwaz Nazari Air Conditioning Solutions, to get all of your air conditioning needs solved!" ran the commercial. Nazari Air Conditioning Systems was the third most popular line of air conditioners in Kuwait City. There were only three. To sum it up simply, growing up for Naram had always been...tense.

"What am I not doing?" asked Fuwaz, of nobody in particular. Fatma, his wife, cleaned up the dinner and Naram helped. This became something of a ritual after the sunny days of the air conditioner business were over. Fatma and Naram would tend the weeds of life, cleaning and whatnot, while Fuwaz stewed. That day, Fuwaz was upset because there was a new player in the local air conditioner game. A wunderkind and a foreigner. Liam and Sons.

"You know, I don't even think he's got sons. He's projecting this image of an established family business and it's all a lie!"

"A total lie" said Fatma. She glared at Naram to get him to say something.

"That guy's a faker dad."

"Oh don't patronize me," Fuwaz said with a humph. "They think *he's* going to get The Contract."

Fuwaz was obsessed with the contract. It didn't make much sense. Fuwaz probably mentioned The Contract, Naram figured, something like ten times a day.  It became his goal in life to obtain this contract, yet there was no reason for him to expect that it was even a remote possibility. The Contract was a contract with the government of Kuwait City to build a rainmaking system. The area, in recent years had been stricken by deleterious droughts. Abu Dhabi already had a rainmaking system, though it wasn't clear if it even worked. Fuwaz wasn't all too concerned with the difficulties of building an effective system or actually bringing relief to those suffering during this spectacularly arid age in the region. Fuwaz was concerned with the fact that The Contract was worth three billion dollars. USD.

"They're similar. It's what I keep telling people. If you think about it, air conditioners are really atmospheric modifiers, just on a small scale. Same thing. Basically." Fuwaz would say this a couple times a day as well. In his fervor bordering on obsession, Fuwaz sent Naram to Abu Dhabi to intern in the government, specifically with the department responsible for the ionizers. A Cold War spy kind of setup wherein Naram was supposed to blend in and return with all of the Abu Dhabian secrets. Undetected, naturally. Naram was avidly interested in science of all sorts, but was not at all on board with the rainmaker espionage scheme. Of course he went anyways, he had no choice, but he was hardly successful.

Which meant added pressure when it was time for Naram to go to school. Fuwaz, historically, held a staunch, anti-western worldview. But when Naram got into MIT something changed. "You can save the company," he said to Naram on the day he was leaving. "Get your degrees and come back and we'll reinvent Nazari Air Conditioning Systems. We can even call it Fuwaz and Son's. Once we get that contract, we'll call it whatever you want."

Tires shrieked and tossed Naram's drunken bumble through the past directly into the proverbial Shredder. Groggily, Naram sat up and looked out the windows of the van. He couldn't see anything but fog in every direction. "Where are we?" he asked.

"No idea," said Jin. "DQ has no idea."

"Well I'm sorry that *DQ* can't see a gd thing! Little miss fall asleep and leave DQ by herself to drive in the middle of the night when she's just as tired as you are and -- "

"How close are we, time wise?"

DQ checked the map on her phone. "Fifteen minutes. Christ dude, are you gonna answer that?"

Naram was confused at first. Then, with bloodflow increasing, and sensation returning to his extremities, he noticed a gentle vibration on his thigh. His phone was ringing.

(We see Fuwaz resentment for jiddo, who went into philosophy)

(this ends with them meeting Idris in the fog and her giving them the dossier as well as sending them Oslo Diggins)


### Touchy Subject

(You're introduced to the agents and they talk about what they both think about Winston)

(Where do they get on the trail?)

(they're in the same diner as the one the Crew is going to, in order to avoid them. They'll actually pass one another as the agents leave (farce))

"How'd you get assigned to The Unit?" asked Ezra Fournier.

Bernard Glick woofed down a too-large bite of his eggs benedict. There was no way to chew it without exposing the contents of his mouth to half the restaurant. "I don't think we're there yet champ."

"C'mon. You're gonna have to tell me the story sooner or later."

Glick stared back blankly. Fournier couldn't look away from the churning, tragedy of masticated eggs and english muffin and hollandaise.

"I'll tell you mine alright? How about that?"

Glick loaded another forkful into his tireless, gaping, maw. Fournier was transfixed. He was imagining himself sucked into that blackhole of destruction, taken apart, stringified and then... "Could you, just, I don't know, maybe just close your mouth a little?" Glick complied. "Thanks."

Fournier took up his coffee and sipped. His eyes glossed over and he rested his mug on top of his recently distended stomach, the unfortunate fate of so many middle aged men. "I'm a good agent, you know. You have to be to get where we are."

"Sure sure," said Glick.

"It's a damn shame that a lot of people don't take us seriously. Damn shame. We do good work. Mostly. Now, if I'm being honest, the thing that got me put on The Unit, is part of the reason people think we're a joke. You remember the Newfoundland Incident?"

Glick chuckled then caught himself. "Yeah. Of course. Terrible, just...awful stuff."

"Three bodies in total. You ever seen a body Glick?" Fournier's eyes were haunted. Glick shook his head. "Before that, me neither. Three bodies Glick. Three. Jack The Ripper stuff. I was out there, I was an ace, and I had a partner and we were supposed to stop this guy. I was confident I was going to get this bastard. Ultimately...I helped him get away." Glick agonized and pleaded with his face, trying to squelch the incipient grin he could feel coming. "I've never told anyone how it happened exactly. But since...well I'll tell you. This guy....he was a hell of an actor. A real Ryan Gosling this guy. Real chops."

"Gosling? Ryan?"

"Yeah."

"Really? I -- Drive was alright I guess, but that seems like a reach to me. It's kinda -- "

Fournier put his coffee on the table. "I'm sorry I didn't think -- it was the first -- I mean Gosling's good right? I mean -- Crazy Stupid Love?"

"Oh that's right! He *was* in that. True. Ok, okay."

"Yeah. Exactly, so back to my story. So we find that third body. Just poked to shit, full of holes, like a pin cushion. And it's just on the beach. My partner is thinking about quitting, you can understand a guy wanting to quit after seeing that stuff, which he did ultimately, and I'm well, I'm pretty sure there and then that my career is toast. And then this guy runs up. This dead girl's brother. Guy looks like a car just hit him when he sees the body. Totally demolished. Waterfalls of tears. Floods."

"A *deluge.*"

"Exactly. And so, he says how their mom is still at work and he needs to go grab her. And he's patting his body looking for his keys, totally out of sorts. This guy is breaking my heart Glick. I offer my keys. It was a rental. It's not like I gave him the keys to the cruiser or anything. Still, that guy was gone after that. And we were stranded, and by the time we put it all together, my career was *definitely* over. I had no choice but to jump on The Unit. That or not have a job. I guess I might've written something, but, I don't know. Everyone says that."

"That's...crazy."

"I know. So, you ready? What's your pitiful tale Bernie?"

"Eh, not that. Not Bernie. Just Glick."

"Okay then."

### Now and Forever

"Hello?"

"Again with this? The Diner. Now."

(I don't what Idris says in the diner)

(the machine is all cutting edge laser technology and massive and relies heavily on some not still manufactured ultra-corporate sounding chemical (Dyn-o-gel))

(meg-o-gel)

On their way in Jin, DQ, and Naram walked by a couple of gentleman, a behemoth and a very average-sized man of about forty, walking out. "Thanks," the three said, as the larger of the two men held the door open. You don't see that sort of thing all the time these days.

Idris Klein was a hard woman to miss. She was a boisterous woman, exuberant in every atom of her being, and somehow possessed the quality of being deafeningly, unignorably loud without saying a single word. That diner was popular, packed from sun up to sun down. Still, they saw Idris in her booth instantly.

Jin, DQ, and Naram sat down. Idris didn't look at them. Instead she began constructing a fort with the menus in the rack on top of the table, leaving spaces for each of their heads, but leaving no seams for inspection from the outside. Idris stuck her head in and the three followed suit.

"You have the device?" she asked.

"Isn't this a little over the top? Aren't we attracting more attention than anything?" probed Naram.

"Yes or no."

"Yes." said DQ. "No thanks to either of these two."

"Great. Shut up. Here, take this." Idris' eyes wandered to the top of the menu fort as she began concentrating deeply. A few seconds later, Naram felt something hit his foot. He picked it up, which was difficult because he was hunched over and keeping his head in the confines of the fort of menus. Ultimately he found a biblical mass of paper and duct tape and staple and twine; that phrase -- Project Witchdoctor -- was again scribbled over the cover. "Got it?"

"Yeah...what is this?" asked Naram.

"Your inheritance."

"What?" the three asked simultaneously. Naram flipped through the pages cautiously, since it was collapsing and crumbling like a medieval manuscript on haggard velum. About a third of the pages were singed at the corners or nearly charred all the way through, beyond the point of decipherability. Every now and again he'd flit passed an image of lab-coated scientists with horn-rimmed glasses, either deliberating or transfixedly observing something that had been burned off. In a few the image was overexposed and overwhelmed by some eyeball-shriveling light source, and the scientists looked on through obsidian goggles.

"It's all in there" said Idris. "But for the past few years you've been helping build what's in the box. The history of which is all detailed in that book."

"Wait. I'm confused. *What's* in the box?" asked DQ.

"It's *in* the book. I just said that. Now, just take it and lay low. I'm going to get back to you in a couple of days. There's some people that should be able to help. I really appreciate the help. To be honest, I've already approved your theses. I'm not going to rescind. But do *this*. I'll write any recommendations you need. Anything."

Jin plunged her head deeper into the fort. "What the hell is going on? Naram and I can't just around. I've got plans. Interviews. And Naram...well he's got to get back home. Sell air conditioners."

"*Ahem*" A waitress, Beatrice, was standing at the booth. "Are y'all gonna order anything or...?"

"Toast. Coffee." said Idris.

"We really haven't looked at the menus," explained Jin.

"Too much playing around? Too much fun with the menus, which *I'm* gonna have to clean up? I have to disinfect each one a patron touches you know. I'll be back in five."

The four of them sat in silence until the waitress came back. Jin ordered orange juice and eggs. Just the whites, which made Naram roll his eyes. DQ ordered the Lumber Jack breakfast, and Naram was deciding between that and something called The Stack, but eventually he stammered his way into ordering the same thing as DQ. He said he didn't want to be difficult.

### Paradise in the snow
Oslo Diggins was the kind of man who sits in his hottub, at the zenith of his latest ski resort in Walhalla, North Dakota, and stares down at all of it for hours on end. When he's done he puts on silk boxers and pajamas and a robe, all of it silk, even the ascot. And then he'll smoke in a study devoid of everything but a rocking chair and the snarling, taxidermied head of a wolf. It's one he killed himself. He didn't hunt it or anything. He ran it over during one of those all-too-common whiteout situations that they have in North Dakota. It was a runt and sick on top of that. The pelt still had tire tracks in it. Truth be told, Oslo couldn't bear to look at the thing. It was part of an ever failing attempt to accept responsibility for the death he caused out in the world. And there had been a lot of it.

Oslo Diggins was barely keeping hold on a mind that seemed hell bent on getting lost ever since about two years prior. Because two years ago, Oslo Diggins killed Gates Diggins. His father. A millionaire, philanthropist, former Alpine Skiing Olympian, and a pretty good father at the end of the day if Oslo was forced to deal with the psychical pain and think about it. Pushed him right off the ski lift. There were messy details like just how he managed to get the safety bar up and how then, he managed to throw the notoriously hardy old man from the lift when he himself was such a disappointment physically, but those are lost to time. Oslo had blacked it all out. Shook the hell out of the etch-a-sketch that was his troubled mind. He hardly remembers that day. And nobody else knows about it. Of course they know that Gates Diggins is dead and all that. But not *who* killed him. By that point, everyone had seemed to stop caring. Business was booming.

Someone else came into the room. Doug. A henchman in Oslo's mind. Doug preferred to think of himself as a business partner. "Sir, someone put a batch up for sale on the internet. Some rando. Looks legit though."

"You have the number?" asked Oslo.

"Yes sir."

"Phone." Doug walked to the corner of the room and picked up the phone. It was old, with faded brass, and a dial instead of a number pad. Oslo bought it because he felt it was the kind of phone Rockefeller would have used. This was not at all true. John D Rockefeller was a personal hero of Oslo's.

Oslo dialed the number after a few false starts. There was no answer.

### The Incredible Internet

"Just like that, huh?" said Craig Jones. His son, Tony, was behind him, inspecting the web form his father had just filled out on the computer, a lumbering, paleolithic thing on dial-up.

"Yep. Looks right to me," said Tony, and then he clicked the submission button. Seconds later, Craig Jones was a seller on Craigslist. Obviously, he was not the eponymous Craig.

"Well I'll be dipped. That's mindblowing, right there. Truly."

"Sure," said Tony, who had already moved on from the wonders of Craigslist, and was busy checking if anyone had liked his latest tweet on his phone. Tony scuffled away while his father continued to marvel. It *was* amazing, when you stopped to think about it. Just that morning Craig began an excavation of The Shed In Back that he had been avoiding for years. Until yesterday when his wife, Lucretia, went to trim her rosebushes in the front yard and couldn't find her sheers. Yet another gardening utensil swallowed up by The Shed. Lucretia, as of yesterday, had finally seen enough home-maintenance-miscellany bloodshed at the hands of the The Shed in Back. Craig had to clean the shed, and would be sleeping on the couch until it was done.

Craig had never cleaned out the shed because there were ghosts there, phantasms especially reserved for Craig himself. You see, Lucretia and Craig and Tony lived in the house Craig had lived in his entire life and inherited from his parents. The Shed had been his father's private workplace and had always been strictly off limits to young Craig Jones. Craig Jones' father had been a scientist, a Canadian, and involved in some very odd kinds of science, naturally. Mysterious lances of light would emanate from the shed at the weirdest hours of the night, not to mention the noises that'd slip through the padlocked crease in The Shed's doors. The entire neighborhood was spooked, and nobody really associated with Craig Jones' father or the Jones family in general. That was difficult for young Craig Jones. In many ways, Craig Jones had never forgiven his father. So The Shed In Back was basically the locus of Craig's perfectly understandable daddy issues, unresolved anger and the kinds of monstrous childhood fears that people bury and take to their grave. Craig Jones had never set foot in The Shed until that morning.

It was a mess. There were dusted and cracked vacuum tubes and chipped beakers leaking faintly phosphorescent ooze. There was even a skeleton. A dog. Craig Jones leaned over to inspect it, reading the tag hanging from his collar, and in doing so solved the case of what had happened to  his dog Rocket, whom his father said ran away. It was possible that Rocket had been a casuality in the unstoppable march of science, but it was also just as possible that Rocket had wandered out to the shed with Craig Jones' father and his father had just forgotten about the dog entirely until Rocket was nothing but a pile of bones. Craig Jones' father was notoriously forgetful. There was also a dusty case containing about fifteen tubes of something called Meg-o-gel.

"Well what do I do with it?" Craig Jones asked his wife and son. The kitchen table was covered with all of the dusty curiosities from The Shed.

"Toss it," said Lucretia, who was just happy to have her gardening sheers back. The rosebushes had gotten all out of sorts since they'd been lost.

*Toss it* was a less than optimal solution for Craig Jones. Residue of his painful childhood or no, it didn't seem right to Craig Jones to just throw it all away.

"You could sell it," said Tony.

"No," said Lucretia. "We're not having a yard sale. The house is in disarray. If people see things like this they'll think we're slobs and Philistines."

"No one would come," said Craig.

"Not in *real* life. Jeez you two are really just -- on the internet," said Tony. To that point Craig Jones relationship with the internet was something like fire to neolithic man, for him it was indistinguishable from magic. Craig Jones couldn't trust something he didn't understand.

As Craig Jones viewed his items for sale online, he still didn't understand it, but -- and maybe this was just undue confidence from having expunged a lot of daddy-related messiness in the form of The Shed -- he was ready to embrace whatever came next. Two days later he received a phone call.

"Hello, um, is this Mr. Jones?"

"Yes, who is this?"

"Hiya, well, I saw that you're selling some Meg-o-gel on your site, and I'd like to buy. Name's Fournier by the way,  Ezra Fournier."

"Oh wow. This is wonderful. Did you, uh, were you just gonna stop by then?"

"Yeah. Sure. I can be there tomorrow. This is atypical, me being a collector and all, but from the pictures I can tell that this is a particularly good batch, and I was wondering if I could make an agreement to buy them in advance."

"Well I suppose that's alright," said Craig Jones. He could hardly believe this was all happening. He was giddy, smiling spasmodically. His palms were sweating and he had at least three close calls with dropping the phone. "I don't have any experience with the stuff. How much were you thinking Mr. Fournier?"

"How much do you want?"

Craig Jones actually *did* drop the phone this time, and it clanked to the ground, and as he scrambled to pick it up he accidentally kicked it which sent it skidding all the way to the opposite end of the kitchen, underneath a cabinet full of China. He contorted awkwardly on his trying to get the phone.

"Hello?" came Fournier's diminished electronic voice from beneath the cabinet. "Hello? Mr. Jones?"

Craig Jones contorted and twisted a bit more desperately. His spine and various joints were straining themselves in ways he'd never asked them to. He strained a bit more, too much actually, and he pulled or twisted or dislodged something in his back. He had retrieved the phone though. "Hello?" said Craig into the gunk-covered receiver, voice hoarse with agony.

"Oh! Hello Mr. Jones. Thought I lost ya!" The two laughed cordially, Craig Jones in short bursts, as every unnecessary breath sent him to the verge of tears. "Are you alright Mr. Jones?"

"Just great. One hundred dollars." He had to expedite things, since the mere act of conversation had become unbearable.

"Great! Well, I'll see you tomorrow Mr. Jones."

Craig slid the phone along the kitchen floor, and then he lied down on his back, motionless, taking in only the shallowest breaths possible. He was like that on his back in the kitchen all day until it got dark. His wife found him like that when she finally returned home from her annual Night Out With The Girls. In all that time, the phone rang only once. It was an unknown number from North Dakota.

### Cacoethes
(eventually the box just has to be opened)
(what's the best way to reveal parts of this backstory, especially as its being unearthed in this manuscript? without seeming too expository, just a rush of facts)
(also lay the groundwork for this group wanting to find out more of the mystery, firstly, figuring out exactly what happens when they run the machine with the meg-o-gel -> which glows faintly)

The gang, instead of jumping hand in hand off a cliff from sheer boredom, was watching television. Naram remembered the passed couple of days purely in terms of a steady stream of bungled attempts to become a millionaire, court cases in which defendants sought remuneration for the stress of having to appear on court television, and crime procedurals where everyone was far too good-looking to be involved in their purported line of work. A horror movie was on presently. Naram wasn't interested.

Besides someone had to read through the Project Witchdoctor manuscript. The bits of it that were legible and unburnt were...odd. Occasionally Naram would throw out the strangest parts to whoever would listen.

"Project Witchdoctor was a Canadian effort begun by the current PM's father in the late eighties. Top secret stuff. They didn't tell anyone." Murmurs from the audience. He kept quiet until he came across a curious bit of language describing the purpose of the project. "The stated goal of Project Witchdoctor was to secure the meteorological hegemony of Canada, and thereby, to secure Canadian hegemony in general. That's like, a nice way of saying world domination right?"

At least Jin's interest was visibly piqued. "Project Witchdoctor was a Canadian effort to take over the world via a weather control machine. That doesn't sound real."

"It's here," said Naram. He read on. "The project actually was successful after years of missteps and failure. The turning point was this scientist that arrived on the project, and he invented some kind of...material" Naram flipped forward through the pages. "This is weird. His name is blacked out everywhere, or just replaced with, like, a bracketed 'redacted'." The next part made Naram's face go slack. "Apparently, while the substance was kind of the linchpin with the device, people also started losing their minds left and right. That is what 'irrepressible bouts of mania' means, right? I mean, maybe that's why this guy is just basically erased. He's like a pariah."

"A black sheep," added DQ. She also bleated a couple times, to really drive the image home.

"Thanks DQ," said Naram. "And then it says 'running the machine caused unusual behavioral changes in anyone in the vicinity. Generally short lived. Some portion of the effect seems to be occularly transmitted. Darkened polarized lenses seem to reduce the severity and occurance of adverse side effects in all test groups.' What the hell, right?" And then the last paragraph. "Project Witchdoctor ended prematurely when the lab burned down under suspicious circumstances. None of the experiments or technology were recovered in the residue of the fire."

Jin and DQ had turned back to the television, as ominous, minor notes and tritones poured out of the orchestration. "I could have been in Paris right now, living my life, not dealing with this weird ass shit," said Jin. On screen, the film's heroine felt it a good idea to descend into the pitch black, and clearly dangerous pit of this house in which three people had already met their gory end, and a malevolent murderer's spirit was frolicking around and generally having a murderous field day.

Why the inexplicable fascination with staring the horrifying unknown in its toothy face?

She descends eventually, but not alone. She's accompanied by her childhood friend, an ebullient amalgam of black female stereotypes, although, hilariously, she seemed to have no knowledge of the trope that made it practically a sure thing that if anyone was ascending from the basement alive, it wouldn't be her. "She made it through three quarters of the movie," said DQ, "not bad". Lo and behold, Monique did not make it. From then on, DQ was twitchy, constantly shifting in place on the couch, bleating intermittently though she had forgotten entirely why she'd done that in the first place.  "I've gotta open it," she said the moment the danger was over, barring some pre-credits or post-credits, ultra-cheesy jump scare designed to set up a money-grabbing sequel.

"Inadvisable," said Naram, but it was too late. DQ already had on her shoes and coat and then she was out the door. Jin turned to Naram.

"It was bound to happen." She and Naram followed reluctantly.

The three huddled in the back of the van around the massive box. They hefted it outside. DQ, out of nowhere, produced a knife and began to make an incision down the side. Her place was to sort of c-section whatever was inside, and then worry about dealing with closing the gash later. In simple terms, the device -- exposed amid a ribboned mass of cardboard -- it looked like a disco ball strapped atop the chamber of a colossal, Wild-West era revolver. The two other notable features were a kind of hacked-on canister, metastasized out of the side of the colossal chamber, and a screaming big red button. DQ hammered the button, before the other two could intervene.

"What the hell!" shouted Naram, as he and Jin seized DQ by the elbows and pried her away from the device. "What the shit! What if you'd just blown us up? We have no idea what could happen."

"She's all id, no ego." said Jin. DQ wrenched herself away from Jin and Naram.

"Thanks for the psychoanalysis, *Freud*," she said to Jin, sticking out her tongue. DQ walked closer to the machine and checked the canister. "It's empty." She inspected it a little more closely. "Was there anything in that book about," she paused to read the fine and rusting print, "about something called Meg-o-gel?"

### The Death of Craig Jones

He still had a limp. It only happened about every fifteen steps. And it was slight. That said it was nothing like if you'd sprained your ankle. Craig Jones would stop completely in the throes of an overwhelming flash of back pain. His eyes would bulge and his face would jitter in panic when he felt it coming. So he walked around nervous and jumpy, skeptical of any errant movement that could spell his undoing. The effect on onlookers was kind of like watching an easily spooked, aged buck who suspects he is in the process of being hunted, but cannot see from where.

Craig Jones was walking to fetch the case. He was not alone. A man in a sweater vest had appeared on his curb that morning. Craig didn't actually see him appear. Something in his paranoid core had him thinking that man hadn't appeared that morning so much as he had been out there for a quite a while and maybe even since the night before. The man wanted to know about the meg-o-gel. Maybe it was just Craig's aching back, but he was starting to regret ever putting the meg-o-gel on sale, and more broadly, the development of the internet itself. Craig Jones was the type of man who had an inordinate amount of faith in his gut, and he regretted not trusting it now, in regards to bad vibes the very concept of the internet gave him.

"Sir, I'm sorry, I appreciate you helping me lug this case out of The Shed on account of my back, but like I said, it's already been bought. Now, if you're willing to wait for Mr. Fournier to get here so you can try and hash something out, that's more than fine with me, but I can't give you anything." They'd arrived at the shed, and Craig unlocked the doors and threw them apart, which was a mistake. He hunched over, suddenly unable to breath.

"Are you okay mister?" said the sweater-vested man, placing an over-developed hand gently on his back. This man and his sweater vest and his conspicuously ridiculous mustache set off the gastronomic-red-flag equivalent of a vivid pyrotechnic display pleading "DO NOT TRUST THIS MAN". Nobody that muscle-bound had ever warn a sweater vest except ironically. And this man did not have a sense of humor. Again, Craig could just tell. And yet, misgivings and dark premonitions aside, Craig entered The Shed and invited Sweater Vest to come in after him, to help with the case.

At the sight of the case Craig swore Sweater Vest's eyes got blacker, like the adrenaline rush from seeing it dilated the pupils so much that they swallowed up the entirety of his eyeballs. Light didn't fully pentrate the depths of The Shed, so Sweater Vest took out his phone and turned its flashlight on the case. The faded Meg-o-gel logo glinted under the light. "So are you gonna help me or what?" said Craig. The case wasn't lifting itself. In response Sweater Vest edged backwards to the front of the shed, gripped the double doors in his hands, and shut them. Craig could hear the man's breath in the mold-scented darkness. His stomach didn't even throw another red flag -- it just dropped, in Craig's clairvoyant gut's way of saying "told you so."

Luckily for Craig, Sweater Vest was a real pro. It was over quickly.

### Not again

(in which glick and fournier arrive on the scene just as Doug is making his getaway. Doug says that Craig had a change of heart and the duo can take it up with Craig if there's an issue, and as they're walking back doug makes a break for it, inadvertantly bumping into The Trio at the end of which Fournier actually says the chapter title)

"To be clear, when we get there, what do we do?" Fournier was quizzing Glick, who was driving.

"Easy. Give him the money."

"Making sure not to...?"

"Making sure not to tell him that we work for the government or anything like that."

Fournier frowned. "We really don't even want him to know we're Canadian."

"Sure. Of course. Great."

"So show me your accent."

"What're you -- what accent?"

"Any accent. Doesn't matter. American, British, German, Austrian, Australian. French. Well no not French. Could still be Canadian" said Glick.

"I don't *sound* Canadian." retorted Glick.

"You most certainly do. You don't hear yourself? That Northern drawl?"

Glick actually took his eyes off the road, something he was pretty strict with respect to not doing. "Northern drawl?"

"It's a thing trust me. My personal advice to you is don't think about it too much, but maybe affect something like a Boston accent. Even if it's awful it won't be Canadian."

Glick might've said something, but they'd arrived. And a man was hurriedly, scampering to his car on the curb, case in hand. Their case.

Fournier flew out of the car. "Hey, hey, what's -- uh -- what's this?"

The man stopped, adjusted his mustache, the left end of which had slid down to his bottom lip. "Wh -- nothing. There's...I'm sorry, who're you?" said the man.

"We're the people who bought that case you're trying to make off with," said Glick, who'd come around to the other side of the car. About halfway through the sentence he remembered the thing about the Boston accent, so the first part sounded perfectly intelligible and the last part...less so.

"I see. Where are you guys from, if you don't mind my asking?" said the would-be thief.

"We do mind you asking," Fournier butted in. "Where's Mr. Jones?"

The sweater vest guy gulped visibly. Fournier assumed that maybe it was the heat. It was far too warm for a sweater vest. "In back. I'm sorry if there was some prior agreement you made with Mr. Jones but he had a...change of heart." Fournier noted the pause as definitely a little bit suspicious. "But he's in back. We can figure out something. We're all adults." The sweater vest guy indicated the back of the house with a free hand, never letting go of the case. Fournier tried to give a signal to Glick with his eyes, but ended up just fixing Glick with a bulbous, and bulging-eyed glare, which confused Glick.

As they neared The Shed, the party slowed down, Glick and Fournier assessed the situation. They were both getting what can only be understood as pretty unignorably bad vibes from The Shed. The whole idea that human beings have five senses is absolute, total, utter bullshit. There are probably at least a hundred and what Glick and Fournier felt then was that sinking, paleolithic sensation of foreboding. They both knew that they were not going to like whatever was in The Shed. "Hey," said Fournier to the man in the sweater vest, "what's going on?" The man was no longer following them. In fact, he was traveling in exactly the opposite direction, back up through the backyard and to the front of the house. He was doing so in a feverish sprint. "Shit," muttered Fournier.

"Ezra we're gonna have to call this in." Glick was peering into The Shed, his coat pulled up over his mouth and nose.

"Not again," Fournier sighed.


(ends with Glick saying, Not again)
### Not again, reprise

"Not again," said Oslo Diggins, just emerged from his daily jacuzzi soak at the resort summit. Doug had brought him the case of Meg-o-gel from the man on the East Coast, but there were several units missing. This was somewhat of a regular thing with Doug. He almost always succeeded but never without a caveat, like a brawl broke out, or there was a fire, or he had to kill someone. Inevitably whatever he returned with was less than whole.

"Sorry. Things got hot."

"Don't they always with you?" said Oslo. Oslo's clothes were laid out for him on the bed, so he began to change right there in full view of Doug. This also happened frequently, yet Doug was still not quite used to it. "Explain."

"So, well, I get there and this guy has already made arrangements to sell the case to these other two guys. And what can I do? He's this poor old guy and he's falling apart. I snap his neck in the shed."

Oslo cringed. "I don't need the details Doug."

"Sorry. Anyway, I thought I was homefree. Thought from then on it was just a simple matter of loading the case and heading back here. But *they* show up. Literally, right as I'm about to throw the case in the car."

"*They*?"

"These two guys. Really weird accent on the one guy. Impossible to say where they were from. As you might expect they're not exactly on board with me taking off with the case, seeing as they've made prior arrangements with this guy who, unbeknownst to them, is now a corpse in the shed. So I start heading to the back, saying we're gonna work this whole thing out, and then when they're distracted, I book it for the car. But then *more* people show up."

"You've got to be kidding me."

"No, anyhow, I'm in a rush and as I'm looking the other way, I run into, full-force, straight into this guy, some Middle Eastern looking kid, and the gel goes everywhere. There are these two girls with him. And everyone's freaking out and I'm just tryna get outta Dodge, so I throw it all in the case -- or so I think -- and I peel outta there. Turns out, I left some."

Oslo was fully dressed. He sat down on the bed, and pulled his hair back onto his head. "Well go back. It seems obvious to me that either those two guys have my gel or this Muslim kid does, which frankly I gotta tell ya, I find that prospect -- from a National Security perspective -- thoroughly terrifying."

"Sir, how would I even -- "

" -- don't know. Don't care really Doug. Just do it." And then, as was his ritual, Oslo Diggins sat in the lone rocking chair and peered out over all he'd created, through the massive glass window which occupied an entire wall of the room. The road-killed wolf snarled downward with him, though its gaze was somewhat cock-eyed, as there's really only so much even a top-tier taxidermist can do with something that's literally been hit by a truck.

Doug left the room with his head down. He had no idea where he was going.

"And also," called Oslo, "take off that sweater vest. What're you thinking?"

### Rainmaking or Cacoethese II

(when people run when they don't really need to, thereby exacerbated on cop television, sure maybe there's a warrant out for their arrest, but still he seems stupid)

(between the way Sweater Vest pealed off and the way these two guys look kind of dangerous and have guns, and the fact that they have this smoking gun in the form of this weather machine...they peal off and ultimately, upon finding an ultra-secluded place, they run this bad boy.)

Aged 25, largely lacking any cogent plan for the future, also lacking much optimism for where the spooky action of so-called destiny seemed to be taking him, Naram-Sin Nazari, stared down at the lawn whose address he'd found on the internet, and made a choice. The choice involved the tubules of mysterious goop called Meg-o-gel left on the lawn by a man who'd recently made a hasty getaway. The choice similarly involved two men who'd emerged from behind the house and shouted "freeze" with authoritative, albeit ineffective, voices. One of them, in this flash-frozen droplet of time, was reaching ominously into his blazer, where there'd be a gun if he was any kind of law enforcement personnel.

It was unclear why things unfolded the way they did. Jin, with so much to lose, was as one stricken by a Gorgen's stare, muscles and sinew and bone, alchemized to stone. DQ had recognized for a long time, the advantages to playing The Game -- her words -- none too attached to the outcome. She too, like Jin, had cushy jobs lined up that made the ultra-ambitous, type-A segment tremble with envy. But she refused to let that dictate how she played the game. It must have been that, in the pristine, twenty-twenty, clarity brought by sheer terror -- Naram was able to realize that he *actually* had nothing to lose, but a lifetime failing to sell inferior air-conditioners and watching himself become his father. And so, when DQ looked at him for what to do, with the men-who-maybe-had-guns coming up and all that Meg-o-gel just sitting there, Naram chose to be indifferent to how this all turned out, since in the worst case he'd end up not having to go into the family business. In fact, in the worst case, he'd never have to do anything ever again.

He and DQ scrambled to pick up the hastily misplaced tubes, and before they could find out if the two guys coming up from behind the house were cleared to use lethal force if necessary, DQ, Naram, and Jin were back in the van, and rumbling off down the street.

They weren't being followed and he knew it. Yet, one little neurotic particle of doubt had burrowed into his head, and he saw his non-pursuers in every pedestrian and behind every tree and every cop car on traffic duty, he swore would flip on its lights and command them to pull over, guns drawn, when they drove by. None of that ever happened. Instead they drove and drove and didn't talk much. They came to a motel, surrounded by trees and shards of a town. Nobody spoke much. Not even DQ.

Mostly. Eventually, as it does every day, two in the morning rolled around, and DQ could not sleep. DQ rocketed out of bed, looking only mildly deranged, and foraged through her small bag for something to wear outside.

"DQ what're you doing?" asked Jin, more as a method to buy herself for what she sensed was going to happen imminently rather than as an earnest attempt to figure out what DQ was up to.

"It's gotta happen," said DQ, pulling on a coat. She went to the door. "Now I'll ask you a question that's not entirely stupid. Are you coming Jin? And Naram, am I going to have to drag you out of bed or are you coming willingly?"

Naram groaned and pulled his blankets off his head. "Yeah I'm coming."

---

They set the machine up at the bottom of the hill, someplace they'd found after driving past miles and miles of generic forest. Jin and DQ fiddled with the machine, trying to correct insert one of the Meg-o-gel tubes into the mitotic canister. Naram handed each of them a pair of dark-lensed goggles that he'd found on the bottom of the box. On the sides they were emblazoned with a faded Canadian flag. It was difficult to see in the dark but there were smudges on the lenses, fingerprints, and in spots the plastic was gnarled and melted. With the tube empty, the three stood and glanced at one another in tacit agreement. DQ pushed the big red button.

The machine lurched. And then again, and then it was wobbling violently back and forth like a paint mixer with a screw loose or -- more ominously -- like someone was trapped inside and they'd been jolted awake and now they were trying to get out. They each took an unconscious step back. Naram noticed a strange smell in the air. Not strange because he didn't recognize it, but strange because he'd sworn they were completely alone. It was weed.

"You smell that?" he asked.

"Oh shit. Yeah." said Jin. "Where do you think it's coming from?" she asked.

"Yeah, that'd be great to know but, I can't see shit out of these friggin' glasses," said DQ. She began to lift them off her face.

"No! Idiot!" Naram screamed, and he threw DQ's hands away from her face. "'Irrepressible bouts of mania'. Remember?"

"No, but if you call me that again I'm going to irrepressibly kick your ass, so, remember that alright?"

"What the fuck is going on down there?" called a voice from above. At the top of the hill, a murky shadow, washed in and out of visibility against the night sky. For Jin, Naram, and DQ it might as well have been the voice of God for all they could see.

"Nothing. Go away. Please." asked Jin.

More footsteps sounded against grass, crunching in the rapidly chilling air. "What?" said someone. "We should go check this out," said someone else.

Naram would've told DQ to shut it down, or at least try to find some way to. He assumed it would've been useless. The machine, he guessed, was a device that adhered strictly to the Pringles Theory, much like dams or the rapacious, bloodthirsty, undead monsters in the movies they'd watched the passed couple days. That is to say, Naram feared once the device had been turned on it couldn't be turned off. All of that was beside the point anyway, because right at that moment the device shot rays of light into the sky in every, direction, and Naram began to hear music.

Shielding himself from the light, Naram turned away and towards the hill. The music continued, grew louder. He noticed there were about twenty others on the hill. He noticed the air had thickened somehow, into a glittering blue tincture. The last thing he noticed was rather unbelievable and if he wasn't already hearing music from nowhere he would've dismissed it out of hand as a sudden and early neurodegenerative disease or hysteria, but there was no way of denying the angelic choir and dizzying, electronic guitar shredding across the sulci and gyri of his neocortex. They were dancing. One throng was dancing all in step in a graceful, pseudo-balletic mass like a school of fish. Mostly though, they were doing the euphoric, out-of-body-experience type less-than-dancing -- gyrating, really -- which is common(popular? might be funnier) amongst epileptics and fans of heavy metal.

Naram couldn't tell if Jin was seeing the same thing. She must've been though, he figured. A couple of feet away she was staring at the hill and the lawn show it'd devolved into, mouth agape, totally rapt. A dull white down began to percolate on her sleeves. Naram looked up. Snow was seesawing to earth, sublimating pretty much instantly in the summery dirt. Naram looked for DQ and then noticed her on the hill, absorbed in the tippy-toed school of dancers. She'd taken off her goggles.

Then the machine died. Whatever had been hankering for freedom inside it, went away. The hill went black. The air no longer glowed here and there and all trace of lavender and flowers had fallen out of it. The dancers on the hill collapsed in heaps. Jin and Naram loaded the machine back into the van. It was touch and go, as the machine had become molten and impossible to touch or be near for more than a few seconds. It was almost as difficult to drag DQ's dead weight into the van.

As they were driving away, DQ came to. "Why're we leaving? What happened? Why am I in the van?" she asked.

"We ran it. You were dancing." replied Naram.

"Well?"

"Oh yeah, quite. I was only impressed. You never took...ballet by any chance, right?"

Her bewildered face jumped into an ecstatic smile. "So it worked?" Naram nodded. His phone rang.

It was Idris. She breathed frantically into the phone. "4 Watercrest" Then the line went dead.

(Supranational Gaggle of Meteorological Adaptationists also a News Station in Cali)

### TV Dinners

"Ugh. All the houses look like they're made of plastic," commented DQ, as the monotony of suburbia tumbled by on the other side of the window.

Jin was actually from near that part of Boston. "Sorry we can't all be from The Valley," said Jin, eyes rolling up and away from the road.

"I know you are" said DQ.

Naram could hardly remember his little apartment now. After so long, his dorm seemed more like home than that apartment where his room hadn't changed since almost a decade ago. This was entirely thanks to his mother. Fuwaz had long since wanted to change it into a kind of entertainment room, or at the very least rent it out. Fatma refused to change the room in an effort to preserve some shimmer of that boy who'd once inhabited it, and so it stayed untouched, gathering dust and horrifyingly infinite, like a tiny creature caught in amber. What Naram *could* remember was nothing like what he saw swimming around him. "You *do* have to admit, it is kind of awful when you really look at it. Artificial." Jin didn't say anything.

Four Watercrest was no more or less plasticky than anything that surrounded it. It was a middle-of-the-road brand of house, a house made for everyone and thus a house made for exactly no one at all. It was one story and angular. The angles were perfect. No decimals. The house was white. The most daring thing about the house was the three-paneled window that looked out from the living room onto the doorstep. It was the architect's one grasp at a semi-distinguishing feature, something he knew this kind of inhabitant wouldn't like, but they'd tolerate, as was their nature. The three of them stood on the doorstep and rung the bell.

There was a man on the other side of that window. He was sitting on his couch watching the news, eating a tv dinner off a tray. The man was quite obviously wearing a toupee and you could tell because intermittently he scratched his head and his entire scalp appeared to move. Naram rung the bell again and this time the man noticed. He craned his neck backwards to see out the window. He jumped up when he saw the three of them, knocking over his tv dinner. "For Pete's sake!" he yelled, audible through the papery walls and the thin glass. He started to shovel the remnants back into the plastic, compartmentalized dish, then he remembered that he should go and answer the door. He stood reluctantly and brushed off his hands. Then the newscast transitioned into the meteorology portion of the affair. The man's hands shot up to his head as he scanned the room, and then found what he was looking for: pen and paper. He held up a finger to the almost-edgy window. "One second, just one second," he said. He put the paper down on the tv tray and began to write. The segment lasted three minutes.

"Hello," he said once he answered the door. He didn't open it all the way. He just opened it wide enough to allow his face to be seen fully by anyone on the doorstep. "Who are you?"

Naram raised an eyebrow. "Idris sent us. Idris Klein?"

The man's face remained unchanged. "Yeah, I know Idris. But *who* are *you*?" They took turns.

"Naram-Sin Nazari"

"Diana Quinn"

"Jin Chen"

"Great," said the man, nodding. He closed the door. Through the window, the girls and Naram watched as the man dug through a pile of papers on a cabinet next to the tv. Then finally he pulled one out and whatever he found on it seemed to be satisfactory, as he nodded at it for a good thirty seconds. He returned to the door, opened it. "Just to double check. You're Naram-Sin Nazari?"

"Yeah," confirmed Naram.

"You're Diana Quinn?" DQ confirmed with a thumbs up. "And you're Jin? Jin Chen?"

"Oh my god. YES." said Jin.

The exhaled and smiled. "Good...good. Well, come in, come in!" he said, opening the door wide. The three stepped inside and briefly looked around.

"It's actually worse inside," whispered Naram to DQ.

Jin leaned close to his ear. "Now's not a great time to be an asshole."

They sat down on the small sofa, laid out perpendicularly to couch where the man was sitting, against the wall. The room reeked of stale potatoes and burnt gravy.

The man went right to cleaning up the dinner, before the molten gravy could seep any further into the fibers of the carpeting. "So the name's Will. Wilson actually, but just call me Will. Idris didn't really give me any specifics. She just said you'd be dropping something off. Then I'd get directions."

"You really don't know what it is?" DQ asked.

"Nope," said Will. "Don't wanna know either. That's usually how these things go. You don't know, I don't know, and I'm totally just A-OK with the need-know-process. Easier to sleep."

"But we *do* know," said Naram.

"...you weren't supposed to. You weren't supposed to look in the box."

DQ blew a raspberry. "Like we weren't going to open the box. Come *on*. How could anyone honestly expect us not to look?"

Jin sat forward. "Probably by expecting that they were dealing with someone with more self-restraint than a kindergartner." DQ stuck out her tongue.

"Yeah. So we opened the box, and you're probably not gonna believe what's inside," continued Naram.

Will covered his ears. "Nope. Don't wanna know. Sleep. I like my sleep. I like to be able to go to sleep without thinking about...God knows what. Nope. Keep it to yourself."

"So that's it? We're done?" asked DQ.

Will, with food in hand, went into the kitchen. He returned without the food, carrying a sheet of paper. Naram caught a glimpse of it. A dizzying labyrinth of markings and arrows and equations. "Well let's see," said Will. He grabbed the sheet of paper he'd written on during the meteorology segment of the news. He began referring to both sheets, deciphering some kind of code, and writing out words on the paper. "Shit," he said. "Sorry for the language. But shit." He left the paper. "A weather machine? They want me to sit around with a weather machine, until they figure out what to do? Classic SGMA. Classic."

"So now you know," said Naram.

"Well yeah. I guess." Will began shaking his head, slowly at first, but then more confidently, more surely with his jaw clenching. "Nope. I quit. I resign. I, no. No way. Here." He handed Naram the papers, both the key and the transcription. Then he fished in his wallet and handed him a card. It read: "SGMA Member", on one line. Underneath that: "Toward Bluer Skies." On the flip side was an address to KWDZ news. Will, looked around at his tiny shell of home, a turtle receding desperately into his own personal fortress after catching a whiff of danger. "Now you can all do what you want, but I'm outta the game." He motioned for them to get up. He ushered them to the door, out of it. "Don't come back," he said once they were outside. He closed the door.

"Fuck it let's leave it," said Jin.

"Leave it!?" exclaimed DQ and Naram.

"Yeah. We did what we were told to do. And more than enough of what we were told expressly not to do. We've had our fun. Whatever this thing is, whatever's going on, that Wilson is clearly scared and I think we should be too. Quit while we're ahead. For all we know, those cops could be coming here right now. I say we go. I got a job waiting in Shanghai. DQ, you've got your thing in The Bay. Naram...you'll figure it out. It's...it's just not worth it."

"You're such a stick in the mud," said DQ. "Literally the most boring person on the entire planet."

"Not literally," corrected Jin.

"Exactly," said DQ.

"Ok. Whatever. Fuck all that. This is a moment. This is The Manhattan Project. This is the Lightbulb. This is...I don't know...Benjamin Franklin and the kite." said Naram.

"Carver and Peanut butter," said DQ. "Gotta represent."

"Whatever," Naram continued. "This is big, is the point. Nothing you ever do will be this big. Nothing. A weather machine could change everything." Jin was shaking subtly, trying to contain herself. "I mean, Global Warming, hello? And not to mention food, crises. We'll be famous. We'll -- " She couldn't take it anymore.

"-- Firstly, the thing about peanut butter is inaccurate. Carver is better understood as a botanist. And you," she said, pointing at Naram, then poking him sharply with her index finger. "How dare you. Nothing. Nothing I ever do will be this big? It's a device that can make it snow. Not to mention, drive people completely out of their freaking minds. Do you even *know* where I'm working? The kinds of issues we're working on, are at least on the scale of weather. So please. Hard to imagine that a little bit of criticism and your enthusiasm to keep going doesn't have to do with me and why *we* don't work."

"Classy." said Naram.

"I for one," began DQ, sitting now on the blacktop, "am glad that the air has finally been cleared, because *whooh* there was some real tension. Did you guys, did you guys feel any of that or -- "

"-- what happens if we don't do anything? If we leave this thing with *Will*? You think Will is gonna know what to do if whoever Idris was so afraid of finally does show up?"

"We wouldn't know what to do" said Jin.

"Fair. But we can do better than Will." A wintery breeze knifed across the driveway. Jin thrust her hands into her coat and pulled her body close to itself. She waddled back and forth. She looked up into the sky, the first vestiges of black night diffusing through the pale blue gray. "You know what? Let's go to the airport. Right now. I'll drop you off and you can get on your plane to Shanghai. I won't call. I promise."

Naram began to walk to the van. DQ followed. From inside the vehicle, they watched as Jin paced back and forth across the driveway. Eventually, Will came to the door. "I'd like you to leave now," he said, eyebrows twisted up, unsure how it was that they were all still there in his driveway. Just really puzzled by the sheer audacity of it. Jin walked, head down, to the van. She got in the passenger seat next to Naram.

"Sky looks like it's about to open up," she said. "Plane'll be delayed, I bet. Let's just go to wherever you were gonna go."

### The Nightly news

Oslo Diggins didn't always just sit in his room and forlornly gaze out of his massive window. At night he watched the news. Religiously. He had strict rules about his nightly news. He was not to be disturbed. Not by anyone, or for anything. Not even if his mother died, and his mother was really the only living member of his family that he liked, even a little. The door was to stay locked. If you knocked, well, if you knocked you couldn't be too surprised if Oslo's personal henchman Doug showed up at your door in the middle of the night, apologized, and then proceeded to shoot and-slash-or strangle you. Obviously, strangling someone after they've been shot is gratuitous, but quite effective when it comes to really driving home the point that Oslo was not to be interrupted if the news was on and it was nighttime.

Theories abounded as to what it was Oslo was up to when he watched the news. They ranged from unsavory to vile. In truth, what Oslo was up to, was rather tame compared to things people came up with. He was only using a codebook left behind by his deceased father -- whom he killed -- and deciphering the encoded messages within short segments of newscast, no more than a few minutes near the end. The weather segments. Oslo didn't understand it all. But it was something his father had shown him. Frequently, they disclosed the locations of newly discovered batches of meg-o-gel, every last droplet of which they were apparently hellishly determined to destroy. And why? Oslo couldn't understand it.

This broadcast was different.

Oslo didn't call Doug. He didn't call anyone. He didn't even call his bag-packing guy. He packed his own bag, and dressed himself. He had the jet prepared.

(the eerieness of the empty resort. He has this interaction with his sister. Who's a fairly distraught mess.)

The resort was eerie late at night. No one was hardly ever up and if they were they were insomniacs and those with such heavy things weighing on their consciences that even the resort's obnoxiously comfortable pillows couldn't do anything to help. Oslo was always up at that time, and when he did venture out and down through the echoing halls of the resort, he never spoke with any of the wayward souls milling about in the dark.

Oslo, in an effort to ensure he didn't come into contact with anyone, went through a part of the resort where there was sure to be no one. It was the part he hadn't quite gotten to renovating all the way, intentionally, for occasions like that one. It was terribly cold there and there was so much dust that you could smell it. Oslo arrived at the final corridor leading to the exit and his private parking lot, but a light gleamed at the end. He tried to stop when he noticed it, but his footsteps boomed in the asphyxiating emptiness. "Hello?" asked a voice near the fire. Oslo ground his teeth and walked towards it. The gleam was coming from a low flame in a small nook. Two high-backed, leather chairs faced the fireplace. His sister Ester was sitting in the one on the right.

"Oh my. Hello Ozzie!" she said excitedly. Ester was the youngest of the Diggins children. Only twenty-five.

"Ester," said Oslo, conspicuously gripping his bags and making no motion toward sitting down.

"Ozzie. Oh come sit, won't you?" She looked at his bags. "Where on Earth could you have to go at," she checked her watch, their father's watch, "three twenty-seven in the morning?"

"Places."

"Oh, come." She stood up and grabbed his arm. She was taller than Oslo. Oslo was the shortest one in the family. He wasn't bothered by it, per se. He was vividly aware of it, yes, thank you very much. But Ester could be as tall as she wanted to be. It was her prerogative. Should he be taller than her? Sure. In a fair world. But the world wasn't fair and Oslo knew that very well. And you could understand him refusing to stand next to her in family photos. And maybe the thing about him refusing to talk to her unless she was sitting down was odd at first glance but he hated looking up. His neck muscles fatigued quickly. No, any suggestion that it bothered him was ridiculous.

Pulled into the left chair, Oslo rolled his eyes at the fire, briefly considered jumping in.

"So Ozzie, we don't get to talk much. Never really. How are you?" said Ester.

"Busy."

"That's...that's good, I guess. For the CEO. I suppose I should be worried if you said that you weren't." She laughed and looked over at Oslo who refused to laugh along. She stopped laughing. "I finished school, recently, you know."

"Congratulations."

"No," she said, "I didn't graduate. I'm done. I quit. That school...just wasn't for me. Just a bunch of pasty, blowhards intellectually jerking off in front of a bunch of kids, basically. It's really kind of perverse when you think about it. And I figured...what's the point? I've always known what I wanted to do."

"And that is?" Oslo dropped his bags.

"Well, help run the company."

"But *I* run the company."

"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm not trying to *impinge* or whatever. Gum up the works. I just want to help. In the little time I had with Dad, he really made me love what he did. And that's another thing. I want to figure out how he died."

"But we, don't we, I thought, I mean, I'm *sure*...look, the police already looked into and they made their decision. Some part of the lift malfunctioned. If I were you, I'd just leave it alone."

Ester's eyes grew distant, she slouched back into the chair. "And that's enough for you? You *believe* that? We know he had enemies. He'd tell me all the time that there were very bad men after him. Near the end, he said he feared someone close to him might turn on him. No. I don't think it's been looked into enough."

"Hm. Well, you are...obsessive? Paranoid. Don't you think?"

"No. Not at all. How could you -- "

"-- okay, okay, here's...to take your mind off this, let's get you a job at the company, whatever department you want. You know we're working on getting that resort in Cancun ready? How does Cancun sound? Yeah, I really think you should go to Cancun. And just stay. As long as you want. Hell, maybe you'll never even wanna come back."

"I'd like to work closer to you actually. We haven't always gotten to spend a lot of time together and -- "

"-- well would you look at that," Oslo said as e checked his phone. " -- just got a text. Apparently they were really expecting me to be on the road by now, and well obviously, I am not. So if you'll excuse me." He stood up, grabbed his bags, and walked briskly to the exit. "Cancun!" he called back. "I know you'll love it!"
---

The biggest question is why would it be so pivotal that they figure out this mystery surroundign the machine? They have the machine already. I just can't think of a reason why Naram would feel so adamant about doing this. Unless...he thinks that the backstory and the history and this mysterious guy is key to the promise of greatness?

I HAVE NOT INTRODUCED THE MYSTERIOUS GUY?

### Pirate Tv

There can't just be a bunch of sitting there you know? It has to be active, active, active... I think the next steps need to be kind of definite, the reader maybe knows what the character needs to do next. Can't just be and this happened and then this happened

Also...where are they? I don't have a definite location, they're just kind of in this van at the moment, driving around and doing things

Story...the Illuminati of a video game world. Arms dealers in the video game world. Someone in the in this world of trading in virtual good. You buy time or you buy gold.

"Well it wasn't easy," said Naram. He'd run into a local shop while DQ and Jin sat in the Van. He handed Jin the decoded messaage through the driver side window.

I wonder. Is there any sort of requirement that one has to have some sort of embodiment of the other world? Something to take with you.

I think the Canadians should show up when they're at the drop off point. Naram doesn't have faith in Will and in the moment, he takes the box under his own care and they head off, plunging head first into this mystery.

"What's The Lot?"

"A parking lot, I think. I have a theory."

DQ grabbed the paper. "Which is?"

"Parking lot. I think it's wherever this news station is?"

--- the code sheet, which looks like some combination of a hastily scribbled treasure map and an arcane spell, the messing up of which might see you turn yourself into a chicken. But on the code sheet there is a clear notice. A phone number to be contacted only in the gravest of situations. A grave situation was not one in which a broadcast seemed like a random jumble of letters. Decipherable only with the most extreme care. The most likely reason for the unintelligibility of the deciphered message was a specific kind of your own incompetence, said the letter. Only SGMA Union certified broadcasts, transmitted by SGMA Union members would contain any sort of message. You were instructed as a member to get into contact with one ASAP in the event of a move (probably sudden), or some other hasty dislocation. You were welcome to call the number for the nearest SGMA broadcast station. If you had somehow obtained this sheet of paper and were not an SGMA Union member, you were asked politely but firmly, to discard the sheet immediately and disregard everything inside.

SGMA stood for Supranational Gaggle of Meteorological Adaptationists.

Naram called the number. "Hello?"

"What do you want?" said the voice on the other end. A young woman's.

"Oh. Okay. I see. All business. I need the nearest SGMA news station."

"Ok." The clicking keys of a keyboard, clacked on the young woman's end of the line.

"There isn't one," she said.

"What do you mean there isn't one?"

"I mean the nearest one is a hundred miles away. There is an SGMA member, however, quite close by. Two, actually."

"Well can you tell about the one whose name is not Wilson?"

"Paul Argyle. And he broadcasts independently. According to this. Address?"

"Mine...or?"

"No thank you. Would you like Mr. Paul Argyle's address?"

"Sure. Yes. Definitely."

"1174 Sycamore Place. Will that be all?"

"Yes, I do think so. Thank you very -- " She hung up.

---

"Most people don't know this," rambled DQ in the back of the Van, much to Jin and Naram's chagrin, "but the address types on the end of an address, like street, road, lane, etc actually mean something. Like place for example. Without ever seeing this place I know it's gonna be some kind of self-contained place. A dead end. Most people don't know that. It's useful information."

1174 Sycamore Place was indeed a self contained area. It dominated an entire crest of a hill, at the end of a windy, and precarious drive. The house was the size of three houses. Naram had never seen a house so large. The outside was crammed with detailed, lacy woodwork with improbably delicate patterns tracing the windows. There was a frieze at the top, depicting several people in the process of being impaled if they weren't already skewered and hoisted on spikes, and at least one individual being burned at the stake. It was quite impressive.

"This exactly the kind of house that becomes haunted. Just wait. Give it fifty years and a lapse in ownership where it can fall in to disuse." said DQ, marveling at the beautifully violent woodwork.

"Agreed. Fifty years and a couple cobwebs and this place'll be scary as fuck." said Naram.

Jin walked to the front door. She knocked. No one answered.

"There's someone out back," said Naram. He walked around to the other side of the house, where there was a pool and a vertiginous fence surrounding tennis courts, keeping any rogue balls from losing themselves in the ample lawn. An older woman was serving over and over again toward a young man who looked like he'd played a lot of tennis. He was tan and the cords of his muscles pulled up against his taut skin clearly in the sunlight. He played the serves effortlessly, never extending, just tracking the ball and returning it in single motions. "Paul?" called Naram. The man stopped and balled whizzed passed him and into the fence with a tinny clng.

"Ha!" said the old woman. "Got you!" The man pointed to Naram with his racket. The old woman turned briefly, then waved her hand, and turned back to the court. "Paul's inside," she said.

"But, do you even know who these people are ma'am?" asked the man.

"No, but if they're asking for Paul maybe they're his friends. And if they're not, at least they know Paul exists, so they're potential friends. Paul needs friends Antoine. And if they're hear to kill him, I'll be sad, but that's not entirely bad either. I'd have my basement back at least." She slapped her hand with the racket. "Alright Antoine lets play a couple. I think it's my day."

The door to the basement was closed. Even so, a slightly moldy smell seeped into the hall through the sliver of space between the door and the floor. And there was the smell of pizza blended into that but it wasn't quite right, like the cheese had long since dried out and the pepperonis -- exposed to the open air -- had changed into something somehow less than pepperoni. Jin slammed the butt of her fist into the door. "Paul?" Something fell hard, and then scrambled over to the door, slowing up as it neared.

"Who?"

"Paul Argyle." said Jin.

"Say we're with the SGMA," DQ whispered.

"We're with the SGMA," said Jin.

The door opened. Paul walked back to his cranny where he'd fallen over in his chair. He was wearing nothing but his underwear. Paul tried to straighten up, throwing books off his desk, brushing the powdery patina of dust from his computer monitor. At the end of it all he plopped heavily into his computer chair and grabbed a piece of pizza from a box sitting on a treadmill that had clearly never been used as anything other than a table. "Feel free," he said, indicating the box of pizza. The pizza had no sheen. It looked like it belonged in a child's toy kitchen, and thus not like anything one should actually attempt to swallow. A clear choking hazard.

"Paul, we're here because -- "

" -- I know. The Machine. Crazy shit. Personally, I don't buy it. Klein's a crazy bird. Always provocative that one."

"How did you know?"

"I watch all the broadcasts man. I have to. I mean, you've seen my show so -- "

" -- no. We haven't."

"Oh." Paul, stopped mid-bite and swallowed. He tossed his half-eaten slice back in the box. "Well, I basically broadcast and sum up other broadcasts. And it's pretty cool." Paul, a thirty-something, had the strange look of a bearded, pitiful, freak-show boy on the playground who'd just had his lunch money stolen and sand kicked in his eyes.

"Why don't you believe it?" asked Naram.

"Lemme show you something." Paul tossed on a pair of sweatpants that were lying inside-out on the ground. He bounded up the steps of the basement and trekked through the guts of the Victorian manor. They came to the back of the house and went down the back steps, past the tennis courts.

"Jesus Paul!" shouted Mrs. Argyle. "Put a shirt on! You're embarrassing me." Paul didn't say anything. He just smiled at her and kept walking by, leading Naram, Jin, and DQ towards a gargantuan building maybe a hundred meters away. "I swear to god Paul if you're going to the pool house it'd better be to take all that shit down. You're not taking over two parts of my house!"

Paul stopped this time. He turned around, arms jutting out towards Antoine. "Are you kidding me mom?! I say nothing about this whole thing, I say not a single thing, even though it's weird as all hell -- and you're still gonna get on my back? Seriously?"

"I have no idea what you're talking about Paul. I'm training. Antoine used to be a fabulous tennis player. Almost made the Canadian Open. He's a wonderful coach."

"Oh yeah mom. I know he's got a great stroke. You were raving about it last night. I couldn't sleep."

Antoine was suddenly, despite expending zero to no effort all day, very sweaty and badly in need of a towel. He grabbed one from near his pile of equipment, placed it over his head, and sat down directly on the scorching court.

"I don't know what you could possibly be talking about," said Mrs. Argyle, quite red in the face.

"All I'm saying is, as long as you're gonna be fucking that Quebecois booty-call and expecting me to look you in the eye on a daily basis, I'm going to keep my shit in back. Okay mom. C'mon guys," he said. "Oh, and it's not shit mom. It's quite important. Matters of national security."

Paul, Naram, DQ, and Jin continued on to the pool house. Behind them on the tennis courts, Mrs. Argyle ravaged her racket, slamming it into the court, like a wife who's just lost it stabbing her no-good, cheater husband, though he was dead a couple hundred stabs earlier.

Inside the pool house, Paul stopped at the door to whatever he was trying to show them. "Listen, I'm sorry you had to see that. It's just...the nerve right? I mean, you get it man. What if that'd been your mom, just casually bangin' her fitness instructor?"

"Oh yeah, definitely. Totally. I get it. Crazy." said Naram.

"Thanks man." said Paul.

The tiny room, amongst the empty and variously cobwebbed containers of pool-shock and chlorine, was a web of red yarn running back and forth between news clippings and blurry photos printed from the internet.

"What is this?" asked Naram.

"C'mon you've seen these right? It's like one of those things. From the movies? That the detectives use to figure out a case or something when nobody believes them, but they know they're right?"

"Or they could just be genuinely insane," said Jin.

"Sure, they could. But they aren't. I'm not." Paul scratched his scraggly beard, swiped his hair out of his face. He patted the residual grease left on his palms into the absorbent cotton fibers of his pants.

"Okay. But...what is this?" said Naram, again.

"Project Witchdoctor man. Totally real, but as far as the tech, I think that's lost to time. Still plenty of intrigue and mystery figuring out what happened and who's involved though. You know the SGMA is a direct result of that?"

"Excuse us one second Paul," said Naram. He, Jin, and DQ walked out of the closet and closed the door, leaving Paul on the other side.

"Ooh. It's kinda dark in here guys. I--that's cool I guess. But if you could, could ya just, keep it short out there. I'm kinda claustrophobic."

"Doubt it Paul," said Jin. The three of them huddled.

"I say we enlist Paul. Show him the machine and have him help us crack this thing wide open." said Naram.

"Are you batshit? Have you seriously, just dived off a cliff, straight into insanity. Hell no. That guys a loser. He's washed up."

"He's been looking into this thing. Nuts or not, that...thing is pretty impressive."

"I'm with Jin." said DQ. "This guy is weird. But, I do think we could get some stuff out of him. I say we show him the machine, get everything he knows, and we dump him. Leave him to die in his mom's basement."

Antoine is a result of Glick and Fournier having bungled up the original scheme. He's a sleeper in the field that Winston deployed a while ago. He begins tracking the kids as well.

---

"No way. I don't believe you. Run it," said Paul as he looked into the back of the van, where the machine was sitting quietly.

"No we're not just gonna *run it* Paul," said Jin.

"Yeah. Weird shit happens when you run it."

"Not to mention the meg-o-gel," added DQ.

"Meg-o-gel? This runs on Meg-o-gel?" Paul slapped himself.

"Paul?" inquired Naram, inspecting Paul's limp face. "Paul?" Paul was unresponsive. In fact, for the next five minutes the only thing was did was stumble backwards from the van, and pace in rigid concentric circles. This lasted for a while.

Unbeknownst to our daring trio and Paul, a certain Quebecois former semi-pro tennis player was watching them through binoculars from the roof, where he was sunning and half-heartedly applying lotion to the spotty hide of Mrs. Argyle. "Oh Antoine, what are you looking at? I can't see how anything out there could possibly be more interesting than what's going on right here. You and me. The sun. The *heat*." Antoine shuddered, but it was all internal. He was, above everything, a professional.

"One moment, *mon canard*."

"Oh Antoine, stop it! You devil."

Antoine put the binoculars down. Antoine squirted lotion into his hand. The name of the fragrance was *Sexy Bitch*. God willing, Antoine would be gone the next day. But first he had to make a call.

### From Sea to Sea

Winston LeBlanc, Prime Minister of Canada was reading through important documents, with his bifocals perched adroitly just short of the tip of his nose. His phone rang. The special line. The one for weather machine.

"Hello?" he said.

"Yes, Mr. Prime Minister this is Agent Big Mac."

"Ah yes. If I'm being honest I can't say I was expecting to hear from you. How goes it? That woman's insatiable right? My god. Never seen anything like it."

"Yes. It is something. It's here though so. Out of the blue. It's here."

"What're...you're saying the machine is there? At the house? How? You're not telling me that idiot, the old woman's son, he somehow -- "

" -- no sir I think it's all just a stroke of good luck."

"I'll say."

"So, kill 'em? They've already seen the thing and as you well know, tying up loose ends tends to be quite the pain in the -- "

" -- No. Christ. Incapacitate them or something."

"Will do sir."

"And toss this phone. You know better."

"Of course sir."

"Antoine? Mon amour? Are you done? I think I'm ready for you to address my other side." Again the shiver, fastidiously suppressed.

"Actually," Antoine began, not looking at the widow, but instead surveying the scene at the van, "I'm feeling sick of the sun."

"Sick of the sun? It's me isn't it?" Her face grew dark and bitter, the jaw dropping to purse the lips into a pout. "Just say it if you're through with me Antoine. You don't have to spare my feelings. I'm just a raggedy old lady. I understand." She stood dramatically, and leaned with nearly all of her body weight on the railing.

"No. It's not that duckling, it's...so warm. Maybe we could go inside. For a little while?"

Mrs. Argyle threw the back of her hand up to her forehead, as though she were seconds from fainting. "So the world doesn't have to see you with an old, wrinkling hag Antoine? You're breaking my heart."

This was an almost daily game. Like she was in the midst of some black and white, Bogart-era romance. "I don't mean to. I'm just tired of sunning. I don't want to break your heart, obviously."

The dowager Argyle then rushed into Antoine's body, pleading pitifully into his face with the affected look of the one of those old cinematic starlets. "Then say it Antoine. Say that you love me!"

"Oh...well...I can't do *that*." Mrs. Argyle sobbed and hurled herself back at the railing. She did this a little too fast, it turned out, and in a brief panic she reached out with her hand to stop herself from accidentally going over. What they say about the dangers of tanning is absolutely true. Mrs. Argyle's hands, in their extremely lubricated state, did little to stop her momentum and she tumbled over the rail. She reached back for purchase as she went, but alas, her fingers slipped and glided along the metal unable to find a solid grip. In their defense, the makers of Sexy Bitch sun-tanning lotion never claimed that their formula was non-greasy. Mrs. Argyle tumbled fatally, not unlike Icarus, through three stories worth of empty air. She landed amongst the tasteless flock of flamingos and cherubim in the front yard.  

(the old woman, being at this point so amply lubricated, tries do a dramatic swoon away from Antoine as he demands he has to go and says she's suffocating him, and she falls off the roof)

(she falls and the group looks up with Antoine, right there and it looks like Antoine pushed her off the roof. Paul was the only who actually caught the entire thing and he says: Jesus Christ, I think the tennis coach just killed my mom. Snapped. Couldn't take it anymore.)
---
Paul Argyle was in the middle of finagling a run of the weather machine out of Naram when he heard the dull, sickening thud to his left. He saw the blotchy, broken body of his mother in the yard. He traced her descent to the roof, where Antoine stood leaned over the rail, staring at the body. Antoine looked at Paul just at the moment Paul's gaze hit him. "Jesus Christ. He snapped. Killed her." said Paul, gradually descending into shock. Antoine recognized that this was one of those point of no return moments. His years of training allowed him to assess the situation so impartially, without the threat of any sort of post-mortem hysterics effected his ability to complete the mission. Carefully strapped to his rippling inner thigh was a compact and easily concealed Ruger, which he removed now, and loosed on the party gathered at the van.
---
Naram grabbed Paul and tossed in the back of the van, and then got in himself afterwards. DQ, since she was the best driver, figured now was an ideal time for her to take the wheel. Jin got in the passenger seat.

Bullets pelted the exterior of the van as it lurched violently from the curb, defribilated from the realm of the dead.

"We're not going to outrun this guy," said Naram.

"Who *is* that guy?" asked Jin, impaling Paul with the knives in her eyes.

"I don't know. He's just a tennis player. From Quebec."

Naram groaned. "Quebec. Oh god. This is not good."

"No." said Jin. "You think he's with the Canadians. The ones Idris warned us about."

"Yeah Jin, I do. I can't really think of any other good reason why a tennis trainer might have a gun in his shorts. And then try to shoot us with it."

"Unless he's got a record," said DQ. "I mean, he tossed Paul's mom off the roof and we were witnesses and maybe he didn't want to go back."

"No, no," started Paul, "this *does* make sense. I've caught him a number of times just lurking in the pool house. Always said he was just taking a swim but he never smelled like Chlorine. Plus he's Canadian."

Naram could hear the sound of a car moving at speeds well beyond the neighborhood speed limit behind them. "Oh shit," breathed DQ. The van's frame shrieked as something careened into them from the back. DQ barely managed to stay on the road. The other car accelerated again. "Brace yourselves," she said. This time, the van spun like the least fun tilt-a-whirl of all time. Naram was nearly crushed under the machine, the centripetal force sent it skidding along the metallic bed in back.

The van came to a stop in the middle of the road. Antoine, in the other car, pulled over. The car door opened, and footsteps came closer over the bits of glass and metal strewn across the street. "What the fuck are we gonna do?" asked Paul.

Antoine stalked close to the van, triumphantly. It'd gotten dicey there for a second. That beautiful smirchless record of his nearly besmirched. He loaded the Ruger. He flung the back doors of the van open. He was blinded by a psychedelic deluge of radiance and a very odd smell.

Jin and DQ, once they were sure it was safe, circled around to the back of the van. The sky was growing petulant and dark. Trees bent in the whipping wind. They found Paul staring confusedly behind his goggles at Antoine who was undulating to a cosmic rhythm no one but him could hear. Naram was staring with bulging open eyes at the van's roof. Jin snapped and clapped her hands but he was entirely unresponsive. There hadn't been enough goggles for everyone, and Paul slapped Naram at the last second, distracting Naram just long enough to grab the last pair.

"Well that's not good," said DQ.

(Antoine proceeds to take out a gun and shoot at the van and the kids have to get going. And they ultimately opt for the turtle strategy, letting Antoine get close and then running the device and turning it on him. There aren't enough goggles, and after a brief run in with the paul, Naram is exposed to the device as well and he sees some things from his past transfigured in weird ways)

Eleanor gets updated on the device. She thinks its absolute madness. But she does want this whole thing looked into. If it's real, and this goes without saying, she wants the device.

### The Cavalry
(Glick and Fournier get brought in, upset to know that Winston had already brought in another agent.)
---

### Naram's Daydream
(some flashback where there's a moment where Fuwaz talks poorly about jiddo and says that they'll never let Naram in, that whole line)

For the rain, driving became impossible. The groaning winds and cavernous shouts of thunder rocked the van from side to side. Antoine, they tied up. And left him back in the house, perversely, in the same room as the latest and late Mrs. Argyle.

Naram was motionless on his back. Not unlike a fish, suddenly dead and floated to the surface after a surge of lightning hit it's little patch of water. This is the image that came to Jin's mind. She'd seen it once. In  a storm. Schools of dead fish floating to the surface after a lightning strike. He looked dead, except for his eyelids fluttering constantly.

"Where do you think he is?" said Jin. She was sitting in the back, a semi-clean sock at the ready, just in case Naram went all epileptic and had to be kept from swallowing his own tongue. She hoped it didn't come to that. It was ok because her feet didn't sweat much.

"Who knows," DQ replied.

In fact, he was a fifteen hour flight away, plus several years in the past, back in Kuwait. He was in his father's shop.

"And what do you say when they say they want the base model?" Fuwaz, his father asked.

"I recommend the silver model." said Naram. He'd been thirteen when this had happened, but in the disfigured dream, he was himself, twenty-five and hopeless.

"Yes, but what do you *say*? Verbatim."

"I'd actually recommend the silver model. For only a hundred dollars more, you could be twenty percent cooler!" said Naram, forcing his face into the manic smile of the salesman, where, it seemed, the most important thing was to show as many of his teeth as possible.

"No. No." Fuwaz looked ready to gauge his own eyes out. "What's...what's that?"

"I was smiling." said Naram.

"*That's* not a smile. It's like you're a gorilla or something. Trying to assert your dominance."

"That's not wrong...right? I mean we're primates, I *am* trying to relieve these other primates -- our customers -- of several hundred dollars."

"Sure, but we don't want *them* to feel like you're eyeing their jugular."

"Whatever dad. No way Jiddo was this hard on you." Naram wanted to suck all the words back into his mouth after he said them, like he'd accidentally drooled in public and had to slurp the cold and viscous rivulet back up, before anyone saw. Instead, the room was like a chamber on a space station, and he'd just opened the pod bay doors, absorbing all the air and sound and jettisoning it all -- himself included -- into the pitiless vacuum of space. "Dad I'm sorry -- "

"-- you don't even know my father. And he wasn't in the shop for even one day. Other than the day he told me he was leaving. No. It was just me and my uncle. And now you. And then maybe your son. A family run shop the way it should be. But you'll have to get your sales-pitch down pat first. The key, Naram, is that you have to make people feel like they're getting a deal here. You don't have it yet but eventually you'll get it. The eye, where you can just tell what they're gonna buy. When you know you start out with the highest models and walk them down to the model you were actually selling them all along." Fuwaz tapped his head. "Mind games. The specialty of every great salesman. But you'll get it. I know it."

Naram never sold a single air conditioner.

---
They awoke at the same time. Naram and Antoine. Naram had experienced the sensation of returning from elsewhere like that one other time. When he'd had to get his tonsils out, and they had given him anesthesia. He remembered waking up delirious, in a restaurant, a bowl of vanilla ice cream and sprinkles put carefully in front him. It'd be little more than ice cream and soup for the  foreseeable future. He remembered his mother's ecstatic face, smiling but not recognizing that he'd only just then crossed the threshold back into the world of the living and was terrified because he had no idea where he was; barely any grasp of who he was, if he was honest. He remembered crying inconsolably and that ruined his ice cream, dilluting it with salty tears. But the worst bit was that he didn't know *why* he was crying, nor did he have the slightest idea how to stop.

Antoine awoke on the side of the road. His head swam with the smell of mud and ozone.

Meanwhile, in a car about an hour away, Glick and Fournier ruminated about their quickly dimming futures. Fournier's phone buzzed when a new message arrived.

### The Weatherman Cometh
(somewhere in washington)
(they're descended upon by several players in this game)
Paul knew of a weather station a couple hours away. He told them everything he knew.

"It's touchy. None of them like to talk about it. It ruined careers. Lives. It was a gamble. Afterwards, with nothing to show for all of it, they were kooks, drained of all credibility in the scientific community. Sure they could still get jobs as meteorologists on the local news, but for them? Hard to think of anything more humiliating." he said.

"Who got them all together?" asked Naram.

"LeBlanc. Prime Minister of Canada. The current PM's daddy."

"Yay for nepotism," said DQ.

"But why?"

Paul's eyes set out on an expedition across the roof of the van, circumnavigated the entire thing including the dingy corners, and came back. "No clue. Can't get anything out of anyone. It's like...well I just get the feeling that they all know, but none of them are willing to say. It seemed like fear with some of em. Something else with others. Like when you don't wanna say anything because you don't wanna look dumb."

"Oh well Naram knows all about them," said DQ, with a look at Jin, sleeping, and then Naram.

"Shut up," said Naram. "One question Paul: why the hell do you give a shit about any of this."

Paul leaned back. "My mom, she's involved. *Was* involved. She's, well, dead now. That's not *my* web in back, in the poolhouse there. That was our project. The old man was a pretty good dude and all when I saw him but my mom was always around. She gave up all of it for him. I think the web was a way to keep from absolutely cracking up for her. And it's not like I made a promise on her grave or anything out of a flick like that. But she got me hooked in and...well I think I owe her that much."

"God damn Paul," said DQ.

"Yeah dude, Jesus," added Naram.

"Can you, like, can you say that? Shouldn't you say like Allah or something?"

"Yeesh," said DQ.

"I'm actually not Muslim Paul, so no."

"Oh," said Paul turning away for another round of van interior exploration. "Why're you interested?"

"Always have been," said Naram.

"And Naram's nosy as shit," said DQ.

"*Curious* as shit. I couldn't not put the thing together, ok? And *you* helped so you're not an angel or anything *Diana*." DQ flung ocular daggers. "No way to know it was gonna turn out like this."

"And you Diana?" Paul asked.

"DQ, Paul. Everyone that's ever called me Diana is dead. If you get what I mean."

"Yeah I think so." Naram watched as Paul's Adam's apple surged in a gulp.

"Great. Well Paul, normally I don't give a shit about meteorology or the weather. But as it turns out, there are some riveting Robotics in the thing. Naram just wanted me to build what was in the schematic but that's not how I roll. Tech and The Field has moved on so far since then that it didn't make sense to build Cumulus 1.0 over again when you could have the next generation. Couldn't get around the pesky Meg-o-gel necessity though."

Naram saw the gulp again. "Did you just say Meg-o-gel?" asked Paul.

"Yeah," said DQ. "Even Miss. Chen -- some would prefer if that were Mrs. Nazari -- even she couldn't crack. And she's like stupid at Chemistry. Stupid in the sense of the exact opposite of the word. She's a genius. Wound up as all hell, but brilliant."

"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. And you guys haven't noticed anything weird since all this started. No ones come after you, aside from Antoine."

"When we first started out, there was some weirdness with three guys. Two guys chasing another guy," explained Naram. "The guy they were chasing -- he was wearing a sweater vest for some reason -- he got away but not before slamming into me and dropping everything he was carrying. A case of the stuff. In his rush to get the hell outta there he dropped some."

"So you stole from *them*!" said Paul.

"Them?" Naram asked.

"Some really bad *hombres*," said Paul. "Meg-o-gel is like catnip to these guys and they've figured out a way to trace the shit. Not to mention you also fucking stole from them. They're coming for you. No way their not. We're in more danger than I thought. These psychopaths and the Canadians."

Night had started to drift down, dusting the streets and stunted buildings in a melancholy haze, when they arrived at the station. Jin was still asleep so they left her. They were at the door when DQ noticed that Paul was wearing nothing but his underwear. "Can you give him some clothes Naram?"

"No time," said Paul. "Besides it's fine. Just neither of you say anything. They'll recognize me. These are *my* people."

The inside was linoleum and heartless chartreuse walls. Curious stains pocked the floor in intervals that corresponded with convex and panicked spots in the ceiling. "The command center," said Paul at the maw of a busy room, out of which the choking scent of dust wafted. There was a bucket to the right just before the doorway. It was nearly brimming over with the jaundiced water dripping through the panels of the ceiling.

The setup in the "command center" looked nothing like a place where any kind of important decisions were made. It didn't even look like something that could have passed for a ho-hum, modern newsroom. It looked more like a knock-off of the set of Jeopardy!, with a gigantic three-by-three wall of flickering monitors, amidst a sea of wires and carts just about to buckle under the weight of archaic televisions. No body knew the three were there, or even alive.. Each of the sweat-stained, exasperated bodies in the room was watching the wall of monitors. Each glowing square changed in its own time, until the entire wall was the tessellated, mustachioed face of one Ben Abraham, Meteorologist.

There was nothing odd about any of it. Besides the Wizard of Oz head leering down at them. It was just a normal guy on the news giving the weather. Or it *sounded* that way. On some of the monitors on the carts, the three could make out a transcription slowly forming. "Impressive setup," said Paul.

The gathered personnel grew uneasy. The transcription, once it was complete and the humongous head had dithered out of existence, said something that was apparently quite alarming. As more and more of them read the words, the room felt like a pot coming to boil. One second all the sets of eyes glanced at one another, surreptitiously checked the locations of the exits. The next, they were literally trampling one another to escape, like a monster had been loosed in the room. A violent mass of oblong and fear-reeking bodies heaved towards the doorway where DQ, Paul, and Naram were standing. The power cut off abruptly. Before it did, Naram saw one woman faint and drift down amongst the stampede of heeled feet. Scenes of Black Friday carnage swam to Naram's mind. Thinking fast, he grabbed Paul, who grabbed DQ and the three of them drifted into a tributary off that main hallway.

They were safe.

The commotion subsided, the three headed outside. To the right of the exit were the bathrooms. The door to the men's room opened, and out walked a small man, carrying a briefcase, and swallowed up in a trenchcoat that slid along the floor behind him in a train. "Hey," said Naram to the man. He turned around, frightened, and dropped his briefcase. With his back against the wall, he fished in his pockets and pulled out his wallet.

"Here," he said.

"What?" said Naram, "I'm not mugging you."

"Oh," said the man. He picked up his briefcase, and a smidgeon of dignity returned to his face. "Well what then?"

"What's the news? Why did everyone freak out."

"Didn't you see? Did you not read the transcription?"

"No. I wouldn't be asking if I did."

"No need to get snooty."

"Sorry. Please."

"The Weatherman. He's back." And then the man flew out of the doors. He threw his briefcase in a Voltswagon Beetle, and ripped off the lot.

Later in the van. "It's worth mentioning maybe," said Paul, "that the lab was burned down."

"By who," said DQ. But Naram already knew.

### Back in The Game

Fournier tried to bask and mirror Antoine's fuming rage, but inside he was smiling. "That's just too bad. Crazy how"

### Storm Brewing

Doug looked out from the cockpit in the failing lume, glum. "Don't look so glum!" Oslo shouted. He was putting the finishing touches on The Plan. The Plan involved one ton of dry ice, Diggins Co. patented Tempest Actuators diffused throughout the present five square miles stretching from the airbase. It also involved a rocket launcher and as much Meg-o-gel as the plane could bear. You might be glum too if you were afraid of heights and had to pilot a plane into a budding storm system.

"Listen boss, is there any way you could shoot from the ground because -- "

"Excuse me?" said Oslo, fuming. He tossed the rocket. That was all Doug needed to see. Like a cobra flashing it's fangs just in case you'd forgotten. Doug was still afraid. He was just more afraid of Oslo.

"Nothing. Forget I said anything."

"I will."

Once Oslo had loaded everything, tied a scarf around his neck and donned a Red Baron cap and goggles, the tiny aircraft lifted off with two men in radically different states of mind.

For Doug, he dare not look down; it looked like the end. He could hear the fizz of sparks in the clouds, like shaken soda. Inexperienced as a pilot though he was, he knew this was hardly the time to be flying a plane. It was in moments like these that he questioned his allegiance to the man sitting behind him, in the gunner's seat. No gun anymore though, so Oslo could just sit there and see how it all came out and yell at him if it all went "tit's up". Oslo had taken to the phrase after binging on kitschy, noir crime dramas one week. Every other sentence for the next month was about something or other going "tit's up". A robbery. A souflee. Point being, Oslo Diggins was a difficult man to please and when he wasn't pleased, Doug heard about it. All at once he felt a lot of pity for that Marcus Brutus guy. He could relate. What was stopping him from barrel rolling right then and there, letting Oslo slip out and fall to his death? Oslo hadn't strapped himself in, so what was stopping him? His stomach for one thing.

For Oslo, staring around himself at the frothiness and sucking in the ozone, he was hallucinating off the vapors of the looming triumph a plan perfectly set in motion can bring about. He'd given the tip to one of the more excitable SGMA stations that the Weatherman had returned. Now he was seeding an awful storm. Whoever had The Device, he was going to weed them out. Make them stop the storm. If they didn't...well obviously he had a contingency plan. But then the vapors were getting to be too much because he saw his father's screaming face in one flash of infant lightning, just the way it had looked that day... He was suddenly all too sober. He loaded the rocket-launcher with one of his homemade Meg-o-gel rockets. He stood up. He loosed the the missile into the roiling clouds wherein it burst, though up there with the engine and the roiling, it was hardly louder than a balloon popping far away.

They did this a few more times. The circling. The loosing of a Meg-o-gel rocket. Then the engine started cutting out. "Sir, I think we have ice."

"Well fix it!" shouted Oslo as he loaded another rocket.

The plane went silent. Oslo and Doug, without the engine, heard only the wind and merciless, slushy raindrops pulling kamikazes into metal and flesh. In the bleakness, the meek engine failure light doused the clouds and water in anxious red. "Sir -- " but nothing else came out because when the plane finally fell to earth, Doug was far too preoccupied with screaming.

Oslo stood up in the descending chaos and beat madly at the control panel and the engine with the butt of the rocket launcher. "Work damn, you. Work! Fucker!" he screamed, though it was unintelligible. If they made it through this, when demur, pitiful Doug would gush over how he'd saved them, he would remember to say something both disparaging and drenched in bravado. Currently he couldn't think of anything, but he *would*. Courage couldn't be further from the truth. Oslo, denting the control panel now, was actually reflecting on what a peculiar little life he'd led; just the kind of peculiar little life that might see him pitied by...whoever, and mistakenly tossed through the purportedly pearly gates of Heaven he thought, horrified. Heaven was simply a place he could not go, let alone live there forever. He suspected there might be a ghost there he didn't have the balls to face.

The propeller blades spun. Stopped. Spun again, and then the engine came back. Doug heaved back on the controls with every last iota of willpower he could summon. It was a rough landing. The left wing was ripped clean off when the clipped the hangar. They plunked into the dirt, slid. The propeller chewed away at the earth, ravenous. Needless to say that was the last time the Lady Lydia ever flew.

Doug helped Oslo out onto the ground. The air was choked with a hazy aura of water. The sky barked. "How...it's a miracle. A fucking miracle," said Doug, hands shaken. Oslo shuddered at the word, but he couldn't convince himself otherwise. All that and no broken bones? Hardly a scrape?

"Fuck me," said Oslo. *I just might make it to Heaven yet* he thought.

"May God have mercy on us all." This was a local weatherman from Dorset, Vermont. Typically, as you well know, news organizations are hesitant to take a staunch stance one way or the other on the whole *God thing*. It's the kind of statement you can get away with in a town with a couple thousand people like Dorset, though. Especially if your total viewership consists of seven people, as did this SGMA weatherman's. What was showing up behind him on the greenscreen did, however, look nefarious. As the weatherman gave his safety recommendations, such as stay away from any and all windows since *there's going to be some* serious *hail by golly!*, he swirled his hand over the furious purple, spiral that had swallowed Dorset.

"We have to do something, right?"

"Seems unwise," said DQ.

"Exactly. I'm gonna head to the van. Anyone know how to get to Dorset."

Jin frowned.

### About time

"What do you think it all means?" asked Fournier. They were driving to a small town. Antoine was in the car behind them. They'd offered to let him ride with them, but he refused. Glick mosied in the driver's seat, like he was trying to scratch his ass hands-free.

"We haven't really been asked to look into what it all means, have we?"

"But its a..." Fournier had this thing with words. Believed there was a power in them. He couldn't bring himself to say Weather Machine. "Controlling the weather? I -- I don't know. It means something doesn't it? About us?"

"People have been trying to control the weather for millenia. Been trying to kill each other just as long as that. Dividing ourselves just as long as that. If *this* says anything about us it's already been said. We've been saying it from the start."

The night was falling but the darkness in the clouds didn't look right. Fournier thought they looked chemical, somehow. He remembered when he'd felt sick in the fourth grade, in the middle of lunch. His mom had packed grape juice for him. The nurse touched his forehead with the back of her hand, asked if he felt "lightning" in his tummy. He said he did. He was positively burning up and as she was calling his parents, his inevitably-upset-at-having-to-inconvenience-themselves-and-attend-to-perpetually-ill-Ezra parents, he vomited all over. It was purple, with spots of haggard, yellow banana. Another girl walked in and then immediately walked out, horrified. Fournier's parents got divorced a week later. He wasn't sure why he was thinking about that now.

"You know, I read somewhere that none of that's true. Those tribes and their ceremonies, they weren't about trying to control the weather at all. Just preparation. Just trying to prepare the populace for the inevitable. Of course, I guess they did still kill a virgin here and there. To be safe."

Glick chuckled, then as he thought about it and discovered how macabre it all was, he stopped. "Man's not really in the business of smiling and taking it from God or whoever else anymore."

"No. I guess not."

### Introductions

They needed open space. Naram made DQ stop at a McDonald's.

"Do you have an wide open area around here?" he asked. The restaurant was empty. The cashier had his back turned to the dining area, he leaned up against the counter with his elbows. He was chatting up this girl who was busy at the icecream machine, pouring cones for everyone. Naram squinted at her nametag. Bernice. "Excuse me?" he said. They just kept talking.

"I thought they were gonna close honestly. You sure I won't get in trouble for this?" said Bernice, handing a cone to a guy with a beard and burgeoning crow's feet.

"No," said the guy with the crow's feet. "They won't miss this stuff. There's too much of it, trust me. Plus, between you and me, it's not even milk. Never rots." Bernice squished up her nose in disgust. "I know, I know. And yeah, I'm surprised they didn't close. Wasn't planning on coming in today. Too bad Mr. Kroc's a money-grubbing bastard." The scent of burning fries wafted up out from deep in the preparation area and the friers.

"What're you talking about!" This was the guy who was too cool to man the cash register. "We hit the fucking jackpot. We don't have to do shit. We can just talk. So Bernice, heard you just had a birthday."

Bernice blushed. She corralled a stray strand of hair behind her ear. "Yeah. How'd you hear about that?"

"I have my sources," said cash register guy.

"Yeah. Eighteen." The would be cashier's priapism was almost audible. "I actually had a pretty crazy night."

"Ooh," said the forty-year-old. "Do tell." Naram couldn't see it but he could tell from the way the forty-year-old glanced up from his icecream cone at Cashier Guy, that Cashier Guy was livid. Everywhere it's the same. The weird, neanderthal, clashing over girls. Even in McDonald's. Even over Bernice.

"Sure, sure. So first we just hung in my friends car and just drank. Not my friend -- who was driving but -- "

"-- Alright," said Naram. "Bernice, I'm just going to have to stop you for a second, because, I've been standing here for five minutes and none of you have even looked at me." Bernice looked up and grabbed at her heart, like he'd sneaked up on her. The forty-year-old dropped his icecream. Cashier Guy leaned back deeper so he could see behind him.

"Oh hey there guy. Didn't see you. Whaddaya need?" said Cashier Guy.

"What's your name?" said Naram. He'd plunged his hands in his pockets, he was waddling, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. His breath felt cold as it hit the back of his throat.

"Oh," for some reason surprised. Cashier Guy, pinched his nametag with both hands, leaned towards Naram over the counter to let him read it. It said Daniel.

"Daniel. Great. Daniel, could you tell me where there's an open space around here." The smell of the burning fries now was oppressive. The alarms must be deceased, becaused the place was starting to smell like it was just a few ticks from going up in flames.

"Hm. The park?" offered Daniel.

"No, that's dumb," said the forty-year-old.

"The airfield!" Bingo. Naram had her write down directions on a napkin. He thought about saying something to Bernice about how Doug was a deadbeat and she shouldn't be anywhere near Doug, but he thought better of it. Besides, he didn't have the time. He did say something as he left though.

"You might wanna check on those fries!"
---

Hail the size of golf-balls. It was bad enough that before they went to the airfield, they made a slight detour to the local Sports Emporium, to pick up a few bicycle helmets.

DQ parked in the middle of the airfield. They unloaded the machine. Filled it up with meg-o-gel.

(they get attacked by Doug and Oslo, mostly Oslo. It devolves into this weird shouting match with Doug and Oslo and third Party, Them, they come and break it all up)

(I'd like to have this moment where Glick)

DQ and Jin made last minute adjustments to the machine, checking valve connections, tightening screws. Naram made sure it was giving the readings he expected. Voltages. A near-neutral PH sloshing around in the machines intestines. Paul was trying not to get hit by the icy meteorites, dismayed by the divots they were leaving in the ground. Paul heard a sound behind him and to the right. A smattering of syncopated thuds, just off the beat dictated by the rest of the frozen projectile percussion section. Seconds later, when the world stopped spinning, Paul was on his back, with a hulking hand around his throat.

"Good evening," said yet another voice. The others stopped tinkering. The man who'd given the greeting walked out of the shadow of the modest, rapidly denting hangar. He was beneath an umbrella that must've been made of at least Kevlar. It was difficult to see his face from the shadow it cast. All they could make out in the gasps of light, was the ascot tied about his neck. "To skip the boring bits like who am I, who is this Modern Prometheus -- " nodding in the direction of the man pinning Paul -- "I'll just say give me the machine or we'll snap your friend's neck."

"I said not to bring him. Didn't I say not to bring him?" whispered Jin.

"You're not moving," said Ascot.

Naram cleared his throat. His Adam's apple felt like it'd grown a few sizes too large and it hurt to swallow. "Sorry. Um...DQ?"

"What?" she said.

*Push the button*, mouthed Naram. She was in the shadow of the van and her hand was already closest to the button. She had the best chance of pushing it before anyone could call funny business.

*What about the goggles?* she mouthed back.

"Um, guys?" said Paul.

"I concur. Guys? What's going on in there?" said Oslo.

*Fuck the goggles*, mouthed Naram.

"Fine. Since you aren't hurrying. I'll count. Five. Four. Three."

Maybe the last injection of Meg-o-gel had been stale. Whatever the case, the force tossed DQ into the front seat, and threw Jin clear of the van. Naram tumbled backwards on his back. Paul and his assailant were sprawled on their stomachs in the dirt. The man with the umbrella was also unconscious. The slowing winds were still strong enough to drag away his absurd umbrella. On his hands and knees, Naram crawled over.

The man was less than a decade older than Naram. Immaculately groomed. Naram even suspected he was wearing a small amount of flesh-toned makeup. The ascot flitted in the wind, and it's silver strands, sparkled in the gleam from the machine. There were words embroidered into the fabric. A name.

No sooner was Naram saying the name of Oslo Diggins than an apparition appeared less than a meter away. A shadow of a man leering down at him. Some fragment of unconscious intuition made him think it was his grandfather. Naram was asking a question when a small hunk of ice smashed him across the head, throwing the kaleidoscopic night into a swirl, a muddy oil painting that grew blurrier with every splinter of time that passed. And then blackness.

Light. Sweat, he was sticking to the seat. He was on a dirt road, trees to one side and an expanse of green on the other. Something smashed the hood. He looked out the windshield and there was a woman standing behind a pickup with someone in the driver's seat. A device reminiscent of a turret was bolted to the bed. She was smoking. She adjusted her sunglasses. There was an ethereal quality to her. Naram guessed it was partly the remnants of meg-o vapors pulsing through him and the lingering effects of whatever it was that the machine and those lights did to people. Sunlight hit the roof and bounced back in her face. She was glowing. Then panic clutched his heart.

He turned around and checked for the machine. It was still there.

"Still there," she said, her voice gravelly and joyless. "Did you think about checking if your friends were alright?" Naram looked to his right. Jin was still conked out but she was breathing. In back, DQ and Paul were lying down but breathing also. DQ was emitting a cataract of drool which her sweatshirt was sopping up in a pooling dark spot. "Didn't think so," she said like she'd made a wager on it. She put out her cigarette.

"Who are you?" he said.

"I think you know I'm not going to tell you that."

"Who's the Weatherman?"

"Oh c'mon," she said with a half-smile. "Not yet."

"Why didn't you take the machine?"

"Because that wouldn't tell us anything."

"About what?"

"About you."

"Don't sell yourself short. Soon you'll be all anyone's talking about." She pointed to a newspaper on the dashboard. Naram picked it up. The Daily Dorset. Triumphant and stretched on the front page was a blurry picture of the van taken from a distance. It was hard to see anything but Naram's silhouette peering into fantastic light pouring out of the back of the van like it was a portal to the horrific, splendor of the underworld. The headline was *Modern Witchdoctor: Man and Strange Machine Stop Dorset's Doom*. Tires clawed at the dirt. Naram threw down the paper to see the woman and the truck speeding off.

He started the van and raced after them. The van gained. He could see the woman smiling in the bed of the truck. She stood and positioned herself behind the turret. She leaned back and aimed upwards. She fired. A beam of split light roared into the clouds, along with a capsule that burst high above them in a modest cough of violet smoke. It didn't seem to have an effect. And then the sky began to rumble. A sudden mist swam along the tips of the blades of grass and mingled with their tires' kicked-up dirt. She waved as fog rolled in and swallowed her and the truck and everything else. Naram couldn't even see the road.

He stopped.

The low wheeze of the pickup's engine weakened and weakened and then there was nothing. Just the wind wading through far away, invisible trees.

### The Dark Side of Meteorology

Oslo jolted awake. Cold sweat coated his arms and legs and his shirt clung to him. It was like he'd been dipped. He looked around. Wires innervated the space, running every which way across the floor, linking outlets and screens and dead cameras. His hands were taped to to the arm rests on a swivel chair and before him was a large desk he could tell was chintzy just from the look of it. Plywood painted to look like oak. He was on a set for some news program.

In the dream he'd been there on the airfield, seconds away from justifying everything he'd ever done, basically opening up The History Books and writing his name. Then the light and agony throwing a riot in his cranium, trying to break out. He'd died, he was sure of it. Dying wasn't the bad part. The bad part was what was waiting for him on the other side. He'd woken up before he saw anything, but the idea was enough to terrify him so much he swore his heart would burst.

The lights came on.

Out from behind one of the cameras marched a young, confident man. He was smiling as he came over. He paused at the desk, smiled some more adjusted his glasses.

"Oh get on with it," said Oslo. He could already tell he didn't like this kid.

"What would you do if you had the machine?" Oslo looked at his hands, taped as they were to the chair, and thought.

"Sell it."

The young man scoffed. "How trite."

"Nothing 'trite' about the quotes I've gotten." Oslo was already rich, but this was private island money. The kind of money that makes people strange and twists them up so they lose touch with reality, behave like the rules don't apply to them. And of course, the rules don't apply. Get rich enough and even death becomes negotiable. That's the first thing Oslo was going to buy: his spot in a freezer for human popsicles. This kid could laugh at him now, but in a hundred years? This kid would be dust and Oslo would be laughing.

"This is bigger than that. We can save the rule. We can rule the world. Finally bring peace. Bring the government's of the world to heel."

"That's enough Dexter." A woman stood in the doorway leading out into a sickly, florescent hall with five others. Two of them were dressed in suits with their hair slicked back like they'd just gotten off of an actual news programs elsewhere. The woman was wearing a cardigan and a floral skirt and she had on thick cat-eyed glasses. Oslo could almost smell her tiny menagerie of felines breezing into the room on a convective air current. Aside from the two men in suits there was a third suit. He was wearing his differently from the other two, his suit lacking any atom of professionalism. The lapels flared wide and his undershirt was unbuttoned all the way down to the pendant -- a crown -- hanging from a gold necklace so brittle it might break any second. Oslo just knew his name was Vinny. *It had to be.* The last guy had just touched down after a long vacation, from the looks of it. His shirt was all pineapples, palm trees, and coconuts with a toucan or parrot thrown in here and there for good measure.

"He's so overzealous," continued the woman in the cardigan, the cat-smell becoming actually oppressive, hurting Oslo's nose. "Evelyn," she said, walking over and extending her hand. Initially she was insulted and confused that Oslo wouldn't at least shake her hand and keep things cordial, when she was being so cordial -- her involvement with his capture notwithstanding. Oslo nodded to his hands, wrapped in mounds of duct tape, up against the arm rests. Her eyes rolled as she was about to say something she'd probably said a hundred times before. "Cheese and rice Dexter! This isn't *CSI*, or something. He's not a hostage! He's a friend!"

The guy in the pineapple shirt walked up behind the kid and smacked the back of his head. "I'm *so* sorry," said the man. "Name's Herald. Dex here is my boy. He's a knucklehead sometimes."

"Shiiiiiit!" said "Vinny". He skated over, all exaggerated movements, and affectations. If Oslo had to bet "Vinny" had grown up in a quaint suburb in the midwest, was beat up a lot growing up, and didn't have many friends. As a result "Vinny" found solace in movies. Gangster movies. "Vinny", he was guessing, had seen the *Godfather* at least fifty times. He was too much of a charicature. It was the only way. Oslo bet "Vinny" wasn't even Italian. Even a slightly. His hair was black but it was obviously dyed. "Vinny" tussled Dexter's hair and grabbed him around the shoulders. "Kid's just excited," that's all. "Nothing wrong with a little enthusiasm, huh?" Herald cringed.

"Shut up Kevin," said Harold. Oslo made a mental note to still call him Vinny. Vinny relinquished Dexter and simpered over near Evelyn.

"Well?" said Evelyn, gesturing to Oslo's restraints. Dexter began to walk over, but Vinny stopped him.

"I got it kid," he said. He took out a switch blade and tried to do that dizzying unsheathing of the blade that anyone in the movies bothering to carry a switchblade can do. It was almost impressive. It was flawless until the end when the mechanisms of the knife stuck so Vinny, frowning, flicked the blade, willed it to cooperate. He cut himself. Bad. *I cut my hand, good god it hurts. My hand!* He kept screaming as he dropped to his knees slowly, like he was deflating.

Evelyn couldn't be bothered. She fixed Harold with a *will you do something* gaze, and motioned to the two suits to help out. Dexter scuttled to the chair and sliced through Oslo's tape fetters with four snips of his scissors.

Blood rushed back into Oslo's hands. Evelyn reached out again and this time Oslo shook his hand.

"Now I don't know what Dexter was saying before," she started, glaring at Dexter, "but our group just wants to obtain the machine. Multiple minds are better than one and all that. I think we all agree that we can't leave the machine in the hands of some...terrorist punk."

"Terrorist?" asked Oslo.

"You did *see* him, didn't you?"

Oslo nodded. Suddenly Evelyn's smell, punching him in the nose even now, wasn't his least favorite feature of hers.

"As Americans we can't just sit around and let one of Them have the machine."

"What happens after we get the machine?"

"The specifics we can discuss later."

Oslo thought about it for a second. In more normal times, he was a lone wolf. The roadkill in his room flashed to mind.

"I'll do it."

"Great," said Evelyn, getting up, and only now looking to see if Vinny hadn't bled out entirely. She looked disappointed when she saw him staring up at her from the floor, bandaged and swaying from lack of blood.

"One thing," said Oslo.

"Hm?"

"Where's Doug?"

### Leads
(they discover the ascot, f and g)
(they try to piece more things together as this conflict between the two sides is brewing)

### Rock and a Hard Place
(eventuall fournier and glick do get captured, as they get captured by the dark meteorology group. And there's tension because they know a lot at that point maybe? Something that'll certainly help the dm's get one over on naram and the gang)

### Chaotic Systems

(Evelyn somehow helps turn the tide against Naram, appearing on a show and saying that we can't know the effects of the weather machine and maybe he's causing extreme weather. And she tries to blame the tornadoes on Naram...?)

### Storm Chasing

(something about storm chasing to stop these tornadoes)

(they meet a captain fantastic like family, a dad, his daughter, and his son)

(and it turns that this isn't just a random thing, the dad gives them another clue or hint at what happened, how to find the weatherman)

###

There's a big problem with the urgency of the story here. Why now, things aren't marching...it doesn't feel like Naram's solving of the mystery of who did what and what's going on actually solves anything. Facts: He's got a weather machine. People are trying to kill him and his friends for. The reasons for that are grokable without any understand of the Project Witchdoctor conspiracy. Getting all the details of what went down needs to be more of a driver. Naram's gotta have some reason to believe that it's imperative he solve this mystery.

I think revisionist history is a big theme here also. Naram's grandfather and father will inevitably have different takes on what transpired years ago.

I think it would make sense if naram had a bit of an ego, wanting to claim this thing for himself, wanting to be one of these great people. And he feels this is his time, somewhat at the expense of everyone else. I don't think he is this lackadaisacal failure, or letdown. I think he's maybe a bit type-A in a way that's kind of self-destructive.

Why solve the mystery though? What does Naram stand to gain? Is there still something he doesn't understand about the machine, maybe the machine was intended to have greater impact, maybe he desires to understand how to control the device better to prevent side effects. And maybe initially that's not the goal maybe it *becomes* the goal since the Weatherman would be the only one that could relate on this scale the only one who could guide him? Help him save the world? I guess he's thinking The Weatherman has some last bit of knowledge that could help him become the savior, but ultimately the device jiddo gives is something about humanity and about the myth of the legendary man, and how maybe there doesn't exist a solution, some solve, some magic

### Mad Science
(i think the rest of the team has bailed a this point)
(this isn't happening in the midwest, Tornado Alley, this is happening near new york, the east coast)

Naram kept playing the words over and over in his head. *You are the problem*. The faces in those crowds blended together in a livid amalgam screaming *Traitor* and demanding he be tossed into a dark hole off the face of the planet. They'd rather that than the machine. They'd rather that than his trying to help. Hard to blame them. Things had only gotten worse.

Then there was Jin. That look. Not anger. Something more like bewilderment, a look he'd seen on the faces of tangled, crumbling minds, battling dementia in nursing homes. Unrecognition.

Now he was on the run. Hadn't showered in a week. Hadn't shaved in months. The van was near out of gas, and there was no gas station in sight. The door hung open. Naram was on his back staring out at a world more like the one in his head, where everything had unraveled and spun upside down. He let the blood rush to his head. The sugary, tepid breeze lapped at his nose. Tenebrific clouds and sky whirled above, looking every bit like the end of the world. Naram didn't care. He closed his eyes and slept.

A mumbling engine ripped him from his nap. It was the engine of a Volkswagen Bus and in simplistic black on the side was written *The Stormchasers Kinder*. The double doors in back shot open. Out stepped a little girl sporting a full-body coating of dirt and a Royals baseball cap. She eyed Naram for a blink, then took the curious contraption she was holding, and pointed it at the sky. A spinning receiver beeped anxiously on top of the curiosity.

"What's it show Jack?" called a man from inside.

"We're screwed, that's what."

A bespectacled man's head jutted out passed the edge of the door, dragging a preposterously long salt and pepper beard in its wake. "What did I say about the language young lady?"

"Sorry," said the little girl. The man adjusted his glasses and smiled at her. He glanced at Naram.

"Ah! So you're alive!" Naram turned over. "Glad that's the case. As you can see," he said, wagging his beard somewhat in the direction of the sky, "we're in quite a pickle. Could really use that gizmo of yours." Naram then noticed that in fine print on the side of the van, in practically microscopic hand, was *SGMA Certified*.

"From what I've found, you're better off with me just sitting it out. Come what may. I might kill one twister. But then five more could pop up. It's unpredictable. Chaos. Hydra."

"You know, I was there."

Naram felt a spark at the base of his spine -- not quite as deadened as he thought. It raced frantically up vertebrae, hit his brain, and burst in a scintillating jubilee. He'd given up.

"The lab?" asked Naram.

"Yeah I was. I knew the Weatherman." Naram's jaw all but fell off. "And we shared a mentor. A pioneer. He figured out that you could use table salt to seed clouds, change the weather. So he did it. Nothing happened. But two towns over? He started a snowstorm. Buried them." Ernst Kinder chuckled, it sounded cavernous, resonated in his chest. "We had this joke. If I stop a tornado in Kansas, what happens in Kuwait?" Naram's face was blank. "Who the hell knows, is the answer. We're in the business of chaos. We can't know the consequences, but if we have the means, shouldn't we try."

"I'm not so sure. It's entirely possible we end up making everything worse."

"You really believe that you're causing all this? You think that you're the reason the weather has suddenly up and jumped off a cliff?"

"I'd like to think otherwise. I would. But...what else could it be."

"I just told you! This game's older than you boy. And there are a lot of people that what that machine out of your hands. You might have the best machine but there are others. I even had one for a while."

"?"

"A jet engine. More or less. Worked too."

"It *kind of* worked," said Jack, shooting a mischievous look at her father from underneath the bill of her hat.

"Oh you don't remember. It wasn't *perfect*" admitted Ernst. "It really had one flaw. You'd start tornadoes just as much as you killed 'em. But that joke? The real point is that a butterfly flapping its wings a foot from where we stand might cause a hurricane in the Carribean. You can prove that."

(this feels like pointless digression about how, in a large sense, weather modification is pointless)
---

The tornado slithered down out of the heaving ether, and clawed at the earth with its malevolent tendril. Naram felt an infantile terror rattle his bones. He distinctly recalled the same sinking sensation when as a kid, he'd gotten separated from his parents and had to contend with being utterly alone. Ernst and Jack were still in the back, but the point was that they couldn't save him. There was nowhere to run. A tornado, it occurred to Naram, is a helpful reminder of how little the forces of nature care for human beings. Maybe a tornado is a kind of revenge.

Ernst drove. The setup was not unlike a tank. Through a hole in the roof, one could manage to stand and shoot something into the twirling tumult. Naram was going to shoot.

"Now kid, when you stick your head out there, don't go all chicken shit on me, alright? We're not exactly safe but we're safe enough. Just aim and fire. You've shot a gun before right?"

"No. Is that going to be a problem?"

"I'd say yes if I didn't think that was going to make you more nervous."

Jack guffawed and loaded the anti-tornado ammunition into the refurbished anti-aircraft gun. She nodded at Naram and he nodded back, then she began cranking away at the wheel that operated the gun's pulley system. Slowly, the gun, platform, and by extension Naram rose through the hole in the ceiling.

Before the ravenous column of wind and fury -- even with the turret -- Naram felt outmatched. He was cold. His limbs shook for the cold and the incredible din, which he feared might bring him to shatter if it hit just the right pitch. He wondered back in some paranoid part of his brain if the gun was even loaded. He traced the possibility that he was being offered up to the nameless God he'd so clearly angered. A different segment of his brain twitched his fingers and fired the turret. Purple pellets sped from the barrels and popped just as they were enveloped in the twister.

Naram did this for five minutes, every second the cycling monstrosity coming nearer and growing louder. And then, the storm began to subside. Ernst jettisoned from the road as fast as the bus would go, but Naram could tell it was over. The winds whipped a bit more slowly, and the howls tapered. And all at once the tornado was no more, just a memory, though behind lay a vast stretch of warped landscape.

### The Meeting

(he should get here through some effort of his own. And it has to be more than just discovering who the weatherman is)

(this doesn't feel right. like, idk, it seems like just a meeting would be anticlimactic, even though this is the middle, it seems like something has to happen)

(and then, if this is the middle, what's the end)

(I don't think the machine works fully)

### At long last

Naram-Sin Nazari held the door open for Jin his -- he wasn't sure. She'd never said. He took in the smiling, rosying faces, waiters and trays of drinks and hors d'oevres slipping by in an intricate tango. Already people were noticing he'd arrived. Distant smiles and curious, mouth-agape heads. Severed conversations in favor of a brief meet and greet with the man of the hour.

"I hate these things," said Naram, though Jin could tell that it was only half-genuine. He looked down at her. She flared her nostrils.

"Mr. Nazari," said a balding man with a white combover, and an old-fashioned, professor cliche tweed jacket. Here was a man who never could have been anything other than an academic. Before that night Naram had never seen the man, he was sure of it. Wouldn't have been easy to forget a mustache like that, one of those curled with copious wax that villains in cartoons used to wear. He looked like he was a snap of his chubby fingers from whisking Jin away and tying her to train tracks somewhere. Naram looked down for Jin, but she was already gone.

This was an after-party for The Meteorology and Natural Sciences Colloquium, held every year in Cambridge, MA. The eminent and most promising meteorologists and scientists, such as they were, would give talks about their research and maybe even demonstrations. Naram's talk, since he was considered a promising meteorologist as a Natural Sciences PhD at MIT, was entitled: "Photo-induced Cloud Seeding". The audience gathered found this to be the most riveting talk of the entire conference. Naram had made the jump from promising, relative unknown to famous, amongst those interested in such topics, over the course of fifteen minutes and thirty slides.

By the time Naram had extricated himself from the throng of academically aroused admirers, Jin was three glasses of champagne deep with another in hand, with Dr. Goldstein, Naram's advisor, whispering to her, his lips nearly brushing up against her ear. Goldstein stared Naram down as he approached, whispering the entire time.

"We were just talking about you," said Goldstein, finishing off the last of whatever was in his tumbler. He grabbed a shrimp cocktail from a passing waiter's tray, almost sending the whole tray crashing into the carpet. He slurped one of the shrimp up, too far gone to bother with removing the tail. He winced as he attempted to chew through it.

"Oh you were?" said Naram, scowling and then looking at Jin. She rolled her eyes.

"Yes we were. I was just telling your girlfriend that fame in academia is a fickle thing. Intriguing research papers are a dime a dozen. As are the fresh-faced, smooth-assed greenhorns who write them. The real mark -- real staying power is in being able to do it over the course of an entire career. And maybe even to produce something more than just a paper. I've done it. I've got staying power. You...who knows?"

"Yes who knows?"

Goldstein swallowed the shrimp he'd been working on with a grimace. He wobbled away.

"Girlfriend?" asked Jin.

"*That's* what you're going to comment on? Not, I don't know, maybe how my advisor, one of your professors was just an immense asshole to me and -- oh hey -- how long have you been sitting over here just letting him shit talk me like that?"

"Maybe some shit talk is good. Might keep that massive ego in check."

"Seriously? I'm here because I *have* to be."

Jin finished off her champagne, pointed to the bar. Two young women were smiling in their direction, and when Naram turned they waved demurly. "I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that you've suddenly got fucking groupies, or anything. I'm sure it's *so hard* for you to be here. Really taking one for the team."

"...wait. Are you *jealous*?"

Jin's head tilted back, an acerbic smile bubbling on her lips. "Jesus Christ Naram. Uh, so I'm leaving now but before I forget: here." She slapped a small envelope into his chest. "Don't call. Or text." Her heels knifed into the carpet as she walked away.

Naram tore open the letter: *Mr. Nazari, you may have everyone else fooled, but I know the truth. Pretty brazen of you to think that -- somehow -- I wouldn't recognize my own work. Maybe you thought I'd be too busy or disinterested to care. Maybe you thought I was dead. For your sake, I'll assume the latter. I'd issue warnings if I thought that'd chasten you. I don't. In a way, I'm impressed you've even gotten this far. I will only say: tread carefully. Brilliant as you think you are, there's much you don't know. - The Weatherman*

Naram's gaze darted into the crowd, searching for a telling flash in the crowd, a knowing face. There was nothing.

Naram decided to head back to the apartment.

---

Nothing exploded. The thought had been scratching the paranoid, reptilian sectors of his brain the whole way back. *They probably rigged the apartment. I'm going to open the door and BAM, there goes the third floor and my newly promising career*. In fact the apartment was not rigged. It was just as he'd left it. Ifrit slunk up to him, stretched, and nuzzled into his ankles. He picked up the little cat, and petted her absent-mindedly. His phone buzzed. He set the cat down, reached into his pocket, hoping it was Jin. It wasn't. It was Paul.

Paul was a guy Naram had met two weeks earlier on the internet, in a chat for weather enthusiasts. Normally Naram avoided such things, but he was desperate.

It all started one day in Goldstein's office. Naram had been asked at the last second to oversee Goldstein's office hours since Goldstein had prior engagements that'd entirely slipped his mind. Naram, even then, assumed that Goldstein was just fucking with him, trying to eat up as much of Naram's time as he could in a misguided attempt to derail his research. Goldstein had left his office in a discombobulated state, Naram assumed, out of spite. There were books and papers scattered everywhere, and the air was choked with chalk dust. As Naram was organizing the papers, he came across a notice saying that Goldstein's application for membership in the SGMA had been rejected.

Naram had never heard of the SGMA, but now, he very badly wanted to figure out what it was and to get in. Goldstein might then be so overcome with vitriol and anger that he'd rather not deal with Naram's presence than force him to man office hours. So went Naram's thinking.

The thing was, he couldn't find anything on the SGMA. It was only when he had nowhere else to turn that he signed up for an account on the enthusiast chat. The chat was known for pedantic, grating conversation about the science of the weather, a place where asking if it was going to rain could result in the most incendiary of flame wars. Naram logged on at a time when the chat saw peak traffic and asked what exactly the SGMA was. In a trickle, user's signed off, and then this turned into a deluge and then there were no more than five people in the chat including Naram. One of them was Paul. Paul said he knew. But he wasn't sure he could tell Naram.

The days that followed were dominated by this coquettish dialogue between Naram and Paul. Paul would reveal a small bit of information, but nothing more.

The text: *Listen. I could lose my membership for this but you're the real deal. There's a guy you can meet. He'll fill you in. He'll point you in my direction. But I can't say anymore. They could be watching... Here: 14 Maple. Lexington.*

(I'm not sure that naram will, or should know that Oslo is trying to kill him, i think there could be something interesting about him misunderstanding the whole thing.)

(maybe Oslo accidentally blows the notes up, after blowing up his car. As an intimidation tactic. Oslo is pissed then determines to come and rough naram up, thinking that naram's in his old apartment, and naram goes along with it.)

Not breathing, he carved the address on the back of his hand. He logged out, closed the window, and leaned back passed what his office chair was made to handle, until two of the wheels lifted off and he almost fell backwards. This could be the break. His Break. You hear about the Big Ones having Breaks all the time; flashes of insight or Destiny herself serendipitously dropping everything they needed right in their laps. Sometimes it'd been there the entire time. Other times, It sublimated out of the air, like magic. The SGMA had been haunting Naram. First it was all over the research. Over and over again like someone was trying their damndest not to get sued there were notices that sections were SGMA certified or were pending certification and that cited scientists were actually in SGMA and not nobodies scuttled in off the streets. There was even the scribbly note of caution on the front: *If you're reading this and you're not in the SGMA -- lawyer up!* Because apparently that person felt getting the absolute shit sued out of you ranked sufficiently high in everyone's untold but everpresent, list of fears.

Naram wanted to tell someone. He picked up his phone thinking of Jin, but then he thought better of it. *Don't call. Or text.* With Jin these weren't mere words. It was getting hard to count the number of times he'd turned minor misunderstandings into week and month long skirmishes, bite-sized wars of attrition that never ended well for him.

Coincidentally, his phone rang just as he was putting it away. Not Jin but an unknown number. If there wasn't the chance that it was Paul, he would've let it go through to his voicemail, but there *was* a chance, and he couldn't just let more information slip through his fingers.

"Hello," said Naram into the receiver, smiling he was so excited.

"Look out the window."

"Wait, who the fuck is this?" Naram said, his blood that quickly tainted and burning. Still, he kicked the chair over to the window.

"Shut up. Look at your car." Naram did so.

"Look I really don't see -- " and then Naram's car hopped, as fire spilled out its guts and propelled it off the ground, the scene calling to mind missions into Outer Space gone awfully, terribly awry. He his mind wandered, and he, for the first time he thought about what it was that could've been the critical flaw, what was the root cause of those failures? A loose screw? Spilled coffee in Mission Control?

"You saw it?" asked the faceless voice.

"Yes."

"Good. So, you know I'm not playing around. This is very serious Mr. Nazari, but none of this has to cost you your life. Just give me the research. Yours and what you stole."

*The Weatherman?* The funny thing was Naram's research had been in his car. All of it. Even the research which he may or may not have stolen. And now it was all just flaming scraps of paper turning to inscrutable, ashen dust in the wind. Of course Naram had backups of his new research on his computer.

"You just blew it up."

"...you're kidding."

"No. You *really* fucked up." Maybe, Naram thought, he was enjoying this too much, considering that even with the object of this extortion blown to smithereens, there was still an evidently murderous psychopath with a bent towards meteorological research, roaming out there in New Hampshire.

The voice came in quick bursts, waffling. "Um, um...backups! Backups, you have backups right? You'd be stupid not to have backups!"

"Hey, you're the one who blew up my research, no need to go insulting me. As a matter of fact if I was so stupid, it's unlikely you'd be blowing up cars and star-67-ing me like a teenage goon -- "

"-- listen you, you...fuck! I'm coming up to Geisel Hall right now, and I'm going to drag you out of room 207. Yeah, not so tough now, huh hotshot? You're gonna give those backups or you're gonna personally tell me every single thing you know."

"Oh god. How'd you -- "

"-- yeah that's what I thought," he made a kissing noise, "see you soon."

The fact that Naram had actually moved out of Geisel Hall 207 three months earlier and was now living in off campus housing did little to calm him. While consciously he was biting his nails and contemplating what the campus paper would say in the event of his sudden disappearance or -- god forbid -- his untimely demise (it wasn't a great headline), his unconscious mind was bobulating information and recent events into a plan.

---

(maybe this is like senior week for jin, dq is a junior)

It wasn't easy. Naram wasn't particularly stealthy by nature and god had given him little in the way of athleticism. Because he thought they'd be quieter, he'd changed into his slippers, the kind old men shuffle around in as they plot their fifth Old Folks Home escape attempt of the day. Naram had the morbid thought that he himself was doomed to shuffle around in them, battling senility and having to be constantly reminded that, no, his wife had been dead for years. He shivered. They were Jiddo's old slippers. The slippers were marginally quieter than the shoes Naram usually wore. He threw clothes into a backpack with his laptop, scooped up Ifrit, and left the room.

He took rocky paths and shortcuts across dewy patches of the green to Jin's.

She was not happy to see him.

"Leave. Now." She said, microwaving popcorn, even though she wasn't supposed to have a microwave. This kind of selective rule-breaking was typical of Jin.

"This is important. A *really* big deal."

The microwave's alarm blared. She removed the scaldingly hot bag and drowned the room in the mouth-watering scent of popcorn and synthetic butter that so tasted like the real thing you'd scarcely be able to believe it. "Isn't everything with you."

"Seriously."

"No," she said, heading to the couch. "We're just starting a movie." A girl lay on the couch on her back, her legs ran up the back and hung over the edge. Jin tossed some popcorn into her mouth, which was opened skyward.

Naram waved. "Naram," he said as an introduction.

"DQ," she said back.

"Fine. Listen. So what if I told you that I thought we should leave now because some crazy shit just happened and I really don't feel like we're safe just hanging around here. What if I told you that huh." Both Jin and DQ continued to stare without blinking, straight ahead.

"*Is* that what you're telling me?" asked Jin.

"Yeah, it was sorta unclear from your phrasing whether that was actually what you were saying or if it was all hypothetical. Wait, *shh*. This part's hilarious," said DQ.

"Yes, I'm saying that. Yes." Ifrit hopped on the couch and situated herself atop DQ's upturned stomach. DQ began to pet her, glossing her coat with dribbles of butter. "Jesus, could you," Naram leaned in front of the television, "do you mind not buttering my cat?" He tried brushing the flecks of salt and kernel out of the cat's fur. "*Our* cat," he added, glaring at Jin.

"Hey don't be hostile. If you're gonna be like that you can *really* leave." said Jin. "Which reminds me, why the hell are you still here? I can't even look at you right now."

"My car blew up!" Naram screamed. The cat leapt from his arms and skittered back to DQ. Angry pounding issued down through the ceiling. Naram looked up, extended a trembling middle finger and yelled: "Go fuck yourself!"

"Oh come on. You may not have to deal with it 'cause you don't live here, but I will definitely have to deal with it. They're actually nice people."

"Really nice," added DQ.

"They're just studious."

"Studious? Aren't you all fucking leaving in a couple days? And yeah, what're you talking about *you'll have to deal it*, you're gonna say goodbye to the entire continent in like a week."

"So your car? You were saying it blew up? How exactly did that happen. Did you like leave it running? I mean, that piece of shit was bound to blow at any time -- "

" -- it didn't just spontaneously go *oh I think now is a fine time to blow up, fuck Naram, always hated that guy!* No. That's not what happened. It was blown up."

"Oh well see that's not what you said," said DQ.

"Could you just," Naram said, "please. Just butt out?"

"She's just stating facts N."

"Ok, we're totally getting off the rails here. Because, to me -- and maybe I'm just out of goddamn mind -- the important thing here is not the semantics. Maybe it's the fact that my car was blown up."

"But how do you *know*?" Right on cue, Naram's phone rang. He knew who it was without looking. He even smiled a little, which was odd, because it was hard to imagine that anything that was about to come over the phone (on speaker) would be in the spirit of levity.







(the man with the combover and the mustache was actually Fournier in disguise)

(Big thing, how are the SGMA and the weatherman connected? Oslo's going to call and scare Naram out into the open, but now it has to be utterly urgent and possible for Naram to get information he needs to move forward with the machine. I have to figure out a way to give more context about the world.)

(Maybe Naram uses his prototype device to get out and head out on his adventure)

### How Naram Found The Research

A befuddling, unlikely sequence of events including murder by Oslo. The documents just sort of ended up in Naram's hand. Maybe this was while he was on a trip with Goldstein.

(anyone that can do light-based weather manipulation is affiliated somehow with the weatherman)

(naram has been having trouble with the psychogenic effects of the machine when he uses it, especially with megogel)

(why the hell would the weatherman help him? he wouldn't)

(I think the weatherman has to leave a clue or otherwise engage naram, bc otherwise it's not clear how naram is supposed to go about his goal of building the machine)

(I need all this setup about the state of the world and hiran anthony's ultimatum, to lend additional timeliness to the plot.)

(What's naram's plan once he's built the machine, what does he ultimately want to do?)

(I think he'll also be threatened by the idea of being exposed by Oslo, but, it seems like being killed would be worsed)

(I have no idea how it is that Naram comes about this new knowledge and new research to get closer to who the weatherman is and uncover more about the technology in the machine)
### The Whole Thing With Hiran Anthony
### How people found naram out
###

### A.B.G. (Always be glowering)
In which we jump back to Doug, contemplating what to do with the phone now that Idris got away, maybe not quite where he decides to turn the tables

Naram tells this guy to "fuck himself." There's a lot of bravado a lot of Naram feeling himself because of the machine. He proceeds to get ill, and throw up all over the side of the moving van

### Thin lines

(Fournier and Glick bend the rules, as they take the entire Jones family in. I think they just talk about it.)

(Glick caught the license plate. Eidetic memory, so he says. Turns up Doug's car which has North Dakota plates)

###

### The End

### The End, really (this is more of a prologue. hate this)
(I don't think he and Jin end up together)
(DQ needs to be somewhere in the epilogue)
Naram sat in his chair on the cafe patio under the awning. He was drinking tea. It was raining. The street was dead except for one bubble of ecstatic life, a group of five kids, kicking a ball through the pooling puddles. Naram heard shuffling footsteps behind him.

"You're late." Naram turned around. His father shuffled towards him on his cane, Fatma guiding him from behind.

"I don't work for you, what do you care?" said Naram, smiling.

Fatma helped Fuwaz into a seat, across from Naram. Fatma sat down next to him. "I know. But I'm old. I keep a tight schedule." Fuwaz looked out at the kids playing. "You know, I've been thinking. Talking with your mother. It almost rains *too* much now. Don't you think?" Fatma slapped his hand, scolding him. "What? You *did* say that."

Footsteps echoed at the front of the cafe, accompanied by luggage clicking along the tiles.

"Hey mom. Dad. You ready Naram?" Jin leaned down, kissed Naram, and then hugged Fatma and Fuwaz.

"I just got here actually, hon. Hadn't really gotten in my morning tea with mom and dad." Jin checked her watch.

"Fine, fine. We'll reschedule." The gaggle of children had moved closer, and a kick gone awry sent he ball under the awning. Jin picked the ball up and walked it out from underneath the awning, tossed it back into play. She stared up at the sky through all the falling water, like she was looking for the spot where, somewhere above all the clouds, someone had turned over a cosmic bucket. Turning to Naram she said, "You think we overdid it with the ionizers? Too much mego?"

"This is what we were saying!" exclaimed Fuwaz. Fatma hit him again.

Naram laughed.


# Appendix

(the storm chasing is an effect of them having to take a stand against the radicals)

(grand belief of jiddo's how countries and all these artificial divides are meaningless)

(I think Naram is identified as having this weather machine, all of them, and they're made to feel guilty over it, bc of things like race and them being unAmerican)

(one glaring plothole is, how does anyone track them?)

(GLICK IS A SPY FOR THE US, A DOUBLE AGENT, although he does acquire a fondness for Fournier in the end)

(there's something they need to figure out, although I was anticipating that it was the sm's who burned down the lab. What's missing? What could they be searching for?)
(idris makes a cursory reference to the supranational meteorologists. The weathermen since she's got a plan to reach out to Gates Diggins. A plan which ultimately gets her killed.)
(something about the essentialness of the now incredibly rare and nigh-defunct meg-o-gel) <- maybe there isn't any and they need to find some

(why now for the canadians? Who / what shot the starting gun?)
(some guy try's to sell some meg-o-gel on Craigslist -> this is the starting gun)
(why does Idris then get all flighty? does she get a call from some canadians or something? I like the thought of her getting scared largely due to a misunderstanding)
(maybe the Canadians have been following up with anyone to get some kind of gauge of the situation. Maybe Glick and Fournier haven't been fully apprised of the situation)

(Oslo Diggins relies on the volatile substance meg-o-gel for his own efforts with the weather modification machines he uses at his father's resorts.)

(Using the machine, loading it up wit)

(Ultimately Oslo starts hunting the kids because they've stolen some of the mego-o-gel)

(they receive a call from Idris phone from the people that killed her, so does Fournier)

(the gang, after they run the machine, they find themselves in the predicament of needing to save themselves, without really being able to appeal to outside authorities because the nature of what the device)

(Oslo and his father had a lot of disagreements over the use of meg-o-gel)

(I think doug betrays oslo)

(how to make naram more active, likable, charming)

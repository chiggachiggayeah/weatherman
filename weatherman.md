## The Weatherman
--
Long ago, there was a wizard.
--
"Hon, you're going to want to get up."

"Hon, I very much do NOT want to get up right now. Please...what time is -- it's not even six. At least give me another hour."

"Hon, trust me. Someone's here and they want to speak with you."

"Lulu, they can wait. They can have some common decency. You don't wake a man to talk before six in the morning. Unless someone's dead, or there's a baby being born -- "

"-- or you're the President of The United States."

Five minutes later and Naram Sin Nazari had just finished brushing his teeth. There was no time to shave. "At least you won't have morning breath," said Lulu at the top of the stairs, giving Naram a kiss, trying to wake him up. "And some women love a little stubble." She grinned at her husband before taking a grim look down the steps.

"Great pep-talk Lu," he said.

"You'll be fine."

 He sat down at the table in the kitchen. It was the first furniture his wife ever designed, where he had breakfast every day. And just like every other day, opposite him at the table was a woman. Every day he admired the woman across from him. Every day he maintained a healthy fear of the woman there as well, believing that to be the bedrock of any good marriage. But every day that woman was his wife and not the Leader of The Free World.

"Good morning Mr. Nazari."

"Morning, ma'am. I mean, Miss, uh, Ms. President."

"Misses, actually, I am married."

"I'm sorry, I just, I'm -- "

"-- I'm only playing," she said, chuckling and drawing a laugh from the behemoth behind her. Looking terrifying and being more massive than any human should must be a prerequisite for being in the Secret Service, thought Naram. Naram gave a queasy grin, took a sip of his coffee, burned his tongue. Jokes are never good in these situations. They always make jokes right before asking you to do something terrible. "In all seriousness Mr. Nazari, I am here on pretty pressing business. I have to ask you to do something. You might find it distasteful at first, but realize that I'm asking you to do this as a service to the country that has become your adopted home."

"Wha-what are you asking? Ex-exactly?"

"The machine. The weather-machine, the...," she looked down at the files in front of her, "the Agi 1."

"...yes?"

"I need you to turn the device over to the US Government."

 In his new, caffeine-alert state, Naram saw the colossus' clench his jaw, overgrown muscles even there bulging. Naram didn't slam his mug down like he had a right to. He just eased it down to the table at about the pace of dripping honey, making sure his hands were incredibly visible the entire time.

"No."

"Interesting," said the President.

"How's that?"

"No, I was just, I was very clear with the phrasing. I practiced it in the car. I was very careful about not making it sound like a question."

"It's mine. You can't."

"You're right. You're a smart man and I bet you know your way around some small print. Can't make you do a thing. I can't, for example, have this man behind me shoot you and then seize the device. The device is sitting somewhere in a hidden lab in Cambridge as I understand, so that wouldn't be too prudent on my part, for one. More importantly, that would be entirely un-American. And you and me, we value American ideals, don't we?"

"Certainly."

"American ideals are about half the reason you came over, that and MIT, am I right? You do like America, living here?" Naram felt his stomach collapsing in on itself like a star in its last gasps of breath.

"Of course."

"I can make it so that you can never set foot in this country again. And maybe I'd make it so you're wife couldn't leave on top of that. Patriotism is sometimes an inconvenient ideal, but it's among the most important. Fundamental. Patriots serve their country. And call me crazy, but if you're going to insist on being so un-American, you can leave." She stood up from the table, gathered her files. "The device will be in the hands of the Government, when everything is said and done. I know this looks bad Naram. A lot of gloom and doom language and then you made me threaten you. I'm not some -- some supervillain, Naram. It's just for the best if the device is in the hands of the government, where we can keep it safe, and make sure it's not put to any other use than making the world a better place. You'll be a hero. I'll make sure of that." She put her hand on his shoulder. It was cold. "I'll be in touch."

### Two Years Earlier

"A weapon?" said Niram. "No, jiddo. I'm a hippie. A total and complete pacifist. I literally just want to save the planet."

"Bureauocrats think everything is a weapon Naram. Nuclear power?"

"That's different."

"Not where it matters. Look around you." Naram and his grandfather stared at the MIT Campus, dusted finely and completely with a spritz of snow. "This is a utopia. Haunted by brilliant ghosts, like yourself. Unable to resist the pull of a place where they could build those things that had formerly only wandered around the larger than average confines of their own heads."

"Jiddo that's not true. Phrenology has pretty much had all of it's credibility remo --"

"-- not the point Naram. I'm trying to say that before you there were many people with brilliant plans to save the world, here and elsewhere. There will be people once you're gone. And here, this is a great place for that. But you mustn't confuse this place for the real world. Even the purest ideas are husks of their former selves when they go out there, if they survive at all. And all too frequently a beautiful dream is mutated and beat into the shape of an ugly and awful thing."

"So what do I do?"

"It is your dream. You've got to be the one to bleed it. Or throw it into cryo-sleep, or -- yes cryo-sleep until the world is ready."

"Cryo-sleep?"

"I've been watching Star Trek. Netflix. It's quite good."

"See I told you. Kirk is the man, right?"

"I think I prefer Spock. He's a more interesting philosophical study, speaking of which," his grandfather checked his watch. "Oh jeez. I've got a class to teach. Philosophy and Pop Culture. Love that class. Now, Naram, before I get into all the ways Piccard is superior to Spock, we're clear on the device? The dangers?"

Naram said he was.

There was a moment in the lab when he thought about it. He had a bat in hand, just standing there in that dark room, three stories below ground, with the air smelling close but lightly tinged with electricity. The machine was humming on standby. Had he not met that lovely girl earlier, randomly in the coffee shop during its graveyard shift, he'd have done it. Smashed the device to bits. He had met her though and they talked for hours, eventually finding that they'd run out of superficial things to talk about. The intelligent, lovely little barista wanted to know, at two a.m., she wanted to know: who was Naram? So Naram began to talk about the weather. Because to listen to Naram talk about the weather was to really understand the core of the man, and to glimpse a little of what is good in humanity. At last, he talked about his potential, and his uncle, and how he was intensely, bottomlessly afraid. The barista, Lucretia but-my-friends-call-me-Lu Marion said "Where would we be if hope never triumphed over fear?" He'd never forgotten that.

### Six Years Before That
(naram's talk with his father)

Be strong. He won't understand. But he loves you. This is what Naram's mother told him before he set off for Al Salam to see his father.

When he arrived, he stood in the mouth of the hall for a moment, just observing his father at work, admiring him. Presently, Fuwaz Nazari was talking to a group of doctors, planning. Fuwaz Nazari didn't talk about his father much but he would tell Naram stories his own father had told him when he was growing up. Fuwaz Nazari had inherited a fascination with the seemingly impossible stories of his people's past. One of his favorites was that of Naram-Sin, one of the greatest conquerors to ever live. Except hardly anyone had ever heard of him. Fuwaz would tell his son "Naram-Sin was just as miraculous as Genghis Khan or Alexander The Great. But the greatness of Muslim people is inconvenient to the west and the Americans and the stories they tell. So they've erased him." Inconvenient. Fuwaz frequently spoke of The West as a grand machine, conspiring against his own people. He said it was his mission to show how great they could be. He said that should be Naram's mission too. No one alive could watch Fuwaz go about his work at the Hospital without being impressed. At work, Fuwaz was his best self. That was the man Naram wanted to remember. Naram filed the image of that great man away, before finally emerging from the hall to tell his father the news.

"I got in dad. MIT" The other doctors' eyes beamed and they patted Naram on the back and they all gave their congratulations. Fuwaz apologized and asked for a moment alone with his son.

"So that's it. You're going, I take it."

Naram ran his tongue around his teeth, maybe trying to prod his face into something else, anything other than the scowl it was converging towards. "You know, most people would be happy. Most parents. Mom was happy. She actually hugged me."

"I have never been interested in being most people. Now isn't any different. Fine. Go be with your grandfather. You two will get along well. You always have."

"This is a great opportunity for me. You always talk about showing the world how great our people can be, well here you go."

"Don't. Don't act like you care about my people. You don't even believe, Naram. Go. Go and be an American like you always wanted. And don't lie and say you're coming back." Fuwaz's eyes grew empty, as he looked away from the world around him and in on one years in the past. He chuckled.

"Is that what this is to you? Funny?" asked Naram.

"In a way. You know there's a theory of humor that says things are funny when they don't make sense. It doesn't make sense to me that you and your grandfather can't see it and it's been happening for as long as that country has been around. They claim to have this open door, freely admitting the people of the world to pursue dreams that are only possible in America. But they'll never let you in."

"Of course they will. I'll have a Student Visa."

"That's not what I mean Naram."

### Present Day

Croesus was an investment firm in the heart of Silicon Valley. Those are just the facts. If you had half a brain you knew Croesus was THE investment firm in Silicon Valley, the world really. For a while there were efforts to track the value of its fund, but eventually that became a virtually impossible task, and people settled for just saying that Croesus had more money than God. The closest historical likeness is probably the East India Trading Company, although Croesus lacked the ability to wage war.

"You're a hard man to get a meeting with Mr. Nazari," said Hiran Anthony, founder of Croesus. "I'm not used to saying that."

"I apologize. I haven't been good about keeping up with email."

"No don't apologize. Never apologize for being in a position of power. There. Just made that up." Hiran snapped his fingers. "Io could you record that for the new book?" No one responded."Io?" he asked again. "Io what're you -- " he turned around and then realized that there was no one else there. "-- that's right. I'm sorry, I'm so used to having my assistant with me." The two were situated in a windowless two story expanse that was all black and metal except for the bright orange slide traversing the two floors. There was also a cold brew coffee machine. Naram had no idea where they were within the building because in the elevator Hiran hadn't pushed a button. When the doors had closed, a voice asked which floor they were going to and Hiran replied: "Sanctum," and this was surely impossible but Naram swore the little steel chamber slid horizontally and diagonally and in four different directions before they'd arrived.

"I'm sorry and this isn't really my place or anything, but is this all necessary?" asked Naram. "I mean, we're in this secret room, and there aren't any windows. And I'm not sure but it seems like this is all soundproof. And you wouldn't even let your as -- "

" -- yes. To answer your question. Yes. This is totally necessary. See, you saying that tells me that you don't even fully understand the magnitude of what you've got on your hands. This is one of the greatest achievements in human history Naram, if you don't mind. We're talking lightbulb-automobile-level stuff, my friend. This is big. I mean, shit man, Cadillac One stopped by your casa the other day."

"H--how do you know about that?"

"Naram. C'mon man. Everyone in the Valley knows about that. It's all anyone's talking about. You've got these people praying like the sky's about to fall just to have two minutes with you. And here you are. You don't take any meetings but then the President comes to your house and she says something and then you come talk to me. Whatever she said, it was either very good or very bad."

A familiar boiling, clamminess flushed through Naram's core all the way to his toes. It was the same angry and terrified combo that hit him whenever he'd bought a car or rented an apartment or sold anything significant. It was the feeling that he was about to be taken for a ride.

"She wants the weather machine or she's kicking me out of the country." Hiran showed his teeth.

"That it? What does citizenship run these days? A couple hundred million or something? That's nothing. A shame. I didn't think she was that kind of president. Look. You sell me the device, your personal services, and whatever operation you've got attached to it and I'll take care of everything."

### Hours Earlier
The President was staring out the window of Air Force One, thoughts flowing by with the gray clouds. Her phone rang. "How'd it go babe?" It was the First Gentleman.

"Not well. I had to threaten him. I'm not -- I'm not that person."

"I know you're not going to want to hear this sweetheart, but, you're the President before you're anything else. You've got a responsibility to the American people."

"And what, he's not one of those people?"

"No, no, no. Of course he is. But he's also created something incredibly dangerous."

"It's not like that's what he's trying to do with it. Naram Nazari, maybe more than anyone else, he's trying to save us from ourselves."

"That's just it sweetie. Naram Nazari isn't the problem. Directly at least. I fully believe that when he runs that machine he's trying to help. But eliminating smog in L.A. might cause a hurricane in Florida or even Australia or South Africa. Drought in the Middle East. And then what if someone with bad intentions gets it? Weaponized tornadoes?"

The President rubbed her eyes. "We don't know that. None of us know the full extent of it's capabilities, aside from what it's been doing in Boston. That it has the potential for weaponized weather is all theory at this point, and the people pedalling it are the curmudgeons and fear mongers."

"But the possibility exists."

"You're right." She sat in silence with her husband on the other end, listening to his breath. Before she was President she would do that sometimes when she couldn't sleep; just wake up and lie there and watch and listen to him breathe. It helped her sleep for some reason. "You know that they want to use it. The Military. They think it can end war. This one. All of them."

"Maybe it can."

"But who are we?"

"Who else? If it does ever end, someone's gotta do it."

"I just don't know."

"It could be bloodless. Maybe you don't give it to the military guys. Maybe you just say to the world: "Look. We control the weather. We'll gladly fix any climate issues you're country might be having, so long as you're not involved in any fighting." Or something like that."

"Behave or else we won't stop that hurricane, the drought or the smog choking your country? The flood? And we pick the Noahs."

"Yeah. You've got a point. What's that your mom said when you told her you were running?"

"She said she hoped I would lose. She wouldn't wish the presidency on her worst enemy."

"Smart woman."

### Present Day

"And you're not going to turn it into a weapon?" asked Naram.

"What? Fuck no. We're not that kind of company. We're gonna stay true to your vision. Correcting the climate catastrophe. Saving the world."

Naram exhaled and for the first time in weeks, he laughed. "Oh my god. That's, you, you have no idea how much better I feel. I was so scared. It was...crushing me."

"I'm glad to hear that Naram. Now there's a little bit of business we'll need to work out."

"Oh. Yeah. Of course. So I'm thinking, because currently it's only small scale like a metropolis, maybe small country scale. I was thinking we could build it up and then just run it. You'd get all the credit. I mean it's the single most important environmental -- "

"-- if it works city by city, I don't know how much we need to scale actually. Country-sized maybe. But we can talk about that later. We'll run the numbers and figure out what to charge and all that."

"I'm...did you say charge?"

"Uh...yeah."

"I just...I mean I wasn't planning on ch-charging really."

"What?" laughed Hiran. "Well then...what's the point?"

"The point? Saving the world seems like enough of a 'point' to me."

"Oh. You were serious about that? I just thought that was like the company motto or something. Listen Naram, if you're not charging, I don't really see a business model and it's not looking like a great investment to me. Unless you were thinking ads or something -- but that's a dark and dangerous road so -- "

"-- I don't think I can sell you the device then Mr. Anthony."

### Early life

There were times when it would rain at Naram's grandparents' home in Lexington, and just he and his grandmother would venture outside in their rubber boots and coats and marvel at the phenomenon. A child's fascination with rain can make it new for anyone who can see that look on their face. On one particular occasion Naram's grandfather was in the kitchen cooking a recipe a colleague from Shanghai had given him. "If it rains here, is it raining in China?" asked a young Naram Nazari.

One thing Ziva Nazari never did for her grandson was water down the truth. One day you're stretching he truth so they can understand and the next you're telling them outright lies, she'd say. "Do you know what chaos is?" she asked the little boy.

"When things are all over the place and nothing makes sense?" he replied.

"Exactly. Weather is a chaotic system. A small change can produce a massive change elsewhere in the system."

Naram crossed his arms and tapped his lip with an index finger. Naram did it because it's what his grandfather did when he wrote his papers and it seemed to be what all the best thinkers did when they were unraveling a particularly knotty problem. "So..." his voice trailed off as he followed the thought a little further. "So rain here, might mean a tornado in China?"

His grandmother pulled him further under her umbrella as the rain picked up. "Perhaps. Or it might mean nothing at all."

"Well that's boring."

"Is it?" she said tapping the tip of his nose.

"Yeah. It's only cool if something big happens."

"Well one little thing will rarely lead to anything big. But a bunch of little things add up in wonderfully odd ways. That's part of chaos. It's impossible to know what little change did it. Maybe it's even wrong to say that any one thing is responsible at all." Naram's grandfather knocked on the back window that peered back into the yard. Dinner was ready. Ziva wrapped her arm around Naram's shoulders, and together they walked up the steps to the back porch.

"Grandma, is it possible to control the weather? Make it rain?"

She beamed proudly at her grandson. "Maybe one day. But just because you can make it rain, that doesn't mean you can control the weather."

### The machine works for the first time and the mysterious man (The Spider)
Naram had arrived. He managed to fish his keycard out of his pocket despite the four coffees he was holding. The coffees were unruly if he used only one hand, so he ran the keycard in front of the sensor using his teeth to hold it. The system beeped approvingly and a flash of green issued from the sensor as the door to his lab slid open.

Amongst the faces gathered there was one he didn't recognize.

Naram's advisor, Dr. Holm, was brimming over with electricity.

"Naram, this is Hank Thompson. Writer for the Boston Globe. He wants to cover your device!" Naram looked the man over.

"No."

"No?" repeated Dr. Holm. He scurried uneasily after Naram who'd already drifted toward some task that waited on the opposite edge of the room. "No?" he whispered again into Naram's ear. He looked back at the reporter, smiled. "Are you nuts. This would be great for you. You'd be famous. Your career would...you do this and the machine works and you'd never have to worry about anything ever again."

"And if it doesn't? No, I don't want that kind of pressure and this guy just shows up out of nowhere? I don't, something about him. Just no."

Dr. Holm turned to the camera and notepad-laden reporter again, smiling a bit less intensely. "Well, it's your decision. I won't talk to him either. And I'll go and take him out of here but I just want to get my two sense in and say that I think this is a very bad idea."

"That's what you said about the machine at first too." Dr. Holm chuckled and walked back to Hank Thompson.

"And it still isn't quite working is it?" he called back, grinning. Sometimes the inconsequential words are the sharpest.

After the professor and the reporter from out of the blue were gone, Naram got up from the workbench and walked over to where Jin was busy soldering a Gordian knot of wires and circuitry. "Is this going to work?" he asked over the creschendoing chaos of sparks. Jin stopped and tilted her mask back. She looked around the lab. The dry-erasable walls were covered in arcane tomes worth of equations and dead-of-night thoughts, so much so that in some places it was difficult to see the white underneath. DQ and Isabel talked in one corner, with a lot of waving arms and erasures. Hunks of machinery lie in heaps in intervals around the center of the room where the device stood, pulsing solemnly. "It's a happy disaster," said Jin.

"That is not really what I was looking for. Gotta be honest. I feel kinda worse now actually."

"I said it was happy!" she responded with her usual effervescence.

"But also a disaster."

"Does this not look like a disaster to you?" she asked Naram, waving her soldering iron a bit carelessly, indicating the room which looked like it'd just hosted the running of the bulls.

"Sure, sure. It's a mess. But disaster? You've already lost hope."

Jin smirked as she flipped her mask down and up a few times, playfully. "No. I never had too much hope in this thing. It's crazy! I had hope in you though. Even if this thing never claws its way out of all this electro-junk to make snow in July, I'll have some fun working on this thing. I mean, how many other times am I gonna get to do something even half as straight-out-of-a-bad-science-fiction-movie as this? Now go. *I'm* actually busy trying to make this thing run." Jin clanked her mask down abruptly. "Ow. My nose." The two laughed and then Jin went back to work.

### Months Later. The Machine runs

The machine was shaking the roof. Just the four of them gathered underneath a cloud-smothered moon, DQ, Isabel, Jin, and Naram. "Should we turn it off?" DQ screamed over the din. He peered down through the roof-hatch into the lab. A pale, blue, ghostly light painted his face like he was glaring straight into the mouth of the underworld and some world-eating monstrosity was trying to claw its way across the breach. Isabel stared at the screen of the clunky controller attached to the main body of the machine via a thick bundle of wires.

"Readings are normal," she said.

"Well they're usually pretty bad so..." quipped Jin.

"I don't know guys," replied DQ. "It's...thrashing."

Naram wasn't really listening. He couldn't take his eyes off the sky. "Maybe it needs more power," he said quietly for no one but himself.

"You're not," Jin started, but Naram brushed passed her and Isabel and DQ and descended into the lab. The machine had etched out a place for itself in the refuse surrounding it. Seeing the way it was wobbling off-kilter in this ever more eccentric and doomed orbit, it reminded Naram of the time his grandparents' washing machine had been on the verge of catastrophic failure and in the process of the collapse had done quite a number on the basement. He shrugged it off. The machine was going to make it snow whether it was on board or not, and if it insisted on taking ninety-percent of the lab with it then so be it. There was, however, an immediate setback.

Every outlet in the lab was connected one way or another to the machine.

"So...what's up?" Naram turned and there was Jin, just touching down from the roof.

"I'm stuck."

"Here? On this? No, no, no, no, no. What's the issue?"

Naram extended his arms. "Do you see any outlets? Or, for that matter, and cords that might be able to run out here and down to the physics lab?"

Jin blew a raspberry into the air. "As usual Mr. Nazari you've latched onto the wrong problem."

A handful of minutes later they were in one of the staff parking lots.

"You're crazy," said Naram, both hands clasping his head as, within its walls, he tried to figure if he had any shot at not spending the night in a cell.

"You're being dramatic. We're *borrowing* it." Jin was saying this as she hefted the battery out of some anonymous professor's car.

"That's a charitable definition of what we're doing right now. If I were an entirely neutral party I might say that we are pilfering -- "

"-- nice SAT word Naz -- "

"-- thank you, but I might say something closer to the truth which is that we're pilfering a car battery and then stealing away in the dead of night, for probably nefarious ends. Point is, it doesn't look good. Most people would say we ought to be thrown in jail."

"Most people aren't building a weather machine," she said finally.

Back at the lab, they shut off the machine and connected their ill-gotten battery. Naram signaled Isabel to activate the device. It jerked to life, as if defibrillated, and the light grew so pupil-dillatingly bright and hot that they each threw up their hands to shield their eyes. And then it shut off. When they opened their it was so dark, it  was like they'd been dropped in a vat of ink.

"It was a good run Naram," said Isabel.

Jin scoffed. "Well we could at least go check for fuck's sake!" she said, climbing up through the hatch in the ceiling. The others followed, except for Naram. Somehow it was better to just not see. His heart was so low then, just staring at the coffee-speckled carpet. They weren't saying anything though. He looked up and felt a flicker in his chest. The moon, so brilliant before, was barely visible behind a deep veil of cloudy sky. Furthermore, goosebumps burrowed up on his skin, as frigid air sunk down through the hatch.

And then it began to snow.

With the falling of each and every new flake Naram gained a bit more belief that this was really his dream, finally congealing into reality. He grasped the rung of the ladder to the roof dreamily. For a moment he forgot exactly how one goes about climbing a ladder, and clumsily strutted upwards. Out on the roof, he felt unrooted in time and tossed into an era that had never existed. People out on the streets stared up in their shirts and shorts and skirts, in awe. Jin slipped her hand into his, and stared up at the sky as well. It was Naram's bad habit to exit from moments like that one, and make some attempt to preserve it forever, rend it into the most impenetrable corners of himself. Naram couldn't recall even an instant when he had ever been happier.

### Knocking at the Golden Door

There's a harpist on retainer at Frank and Fox. Steve Frank's restaurant in New York where excess is always on the menu. A joke of Steve's. He also had joked that even if that bothers you, after a drink and succumbing to the seduction of his contractually obligated harpist, you won't care. There aren't any prices on the menu, since the assumption is that money is no object.

Steve was quite full after finishing half his gargantuan steak. Naram hadn't eaten anything since he'd lost his appetite just about six hours earlier when, on live television during his show, Steve denounced Naram as a traitor in front of a panel of government leaders.

"Do you think the name kind of sounds like Frankenfox?", started Steve. "Like some undead, pieced-together, vulpine horror? I don't know I've just been thinking about it lately and it's been -- "

"-- bothering you? Maybe like it bothered me when you said I was the kind of immigrant that you might be *for* deporting."

"Oh come on Naram. It's TV."

"Oh so it doesn't matter? I should be okay with you insinuating I'm a terrorist?"

"You're getting butthurt over nothing. Obviously I don't really think you're a terrorist. It's what the people want to hear. You have to give it to them. I'm not going to disagree with the President. She's one of us."

"That's it? That's as far as speaking truth to power goes for you?"

"What do you want Naram? Me to say the kinds of things I'd have said in college? Guess what: that's not exactly good television. And what for? Look around. You see how good things are. How they've improved since we were just kids in college, running our mouths for anyone who'd listen. Things aren't perfect but for the most part things in the world are good Naram. Except for the floods and the storms. But you're fixing that."

"The world is burning."

Steve leaned forward into the wilted light of the candle on the table. "Let it. Fuck 'em is what I say. A healthy America is good for the world and we didn't get to where we are now by helping everyone that came knocking. We'll help eventually, obviously. We'll do what we can in the meantime. But you don't mess with a good thing."

"Fuck 'em? I'm one of *them* Steve."

Steve Frank scoffed and paused to take a large gulp of his wine, paired with his meal via a world-renowned somelier, also on retainer. "You're not. You're practically American." Naram stared across the table looking for his friend, who seemed nowhere to be found. Naram stood from the table.

"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door,” Naram recited. "Enjoy the music."


### Chasing Ghosts (I think this is the end)

(maybe there should be something there, but these are the old machines)
The squadron stormed the building, rushed in, threw open the doors...and there it was. It looked a bit like an alien moon, a hundred foot sphere fraught with buzzing and blinking electrical components, the entire surface composed of honey comb divots, deep like impact craters. Just to stand in the same room with the device was to have a more complete understanding of its sheer power. An inaudible wave issued forth from the core of the thing every few seconds. One couldn't see it but one could feel it in the hardware of their chest, and from there it would resonate outward through the extremities, ultimately leaving one slightly off-kilter for a microsecond or two.

Eleanor exhaled shakily. Could this be happening? It seemed too simple. The nightmare was contained, the spider, now situated in plain sight underneath the jar. She walked outside. The sky was writhing. Where sun had bathed everything, there was now an unassailable veil of melancholy gray. The winds and the tumult ceased for a second or two, all sound sucked out of the world by some cosmic vacuum. And then it began to rain. It didn't stop.

### Project Witch Doctor

"Hurry up Franklin. I've got five minutes." Franklin was close to the floor, vertically challenged, no more than a couple inches over five feet. He was also roundish, and clumsy, and still nervous around the President. It was only a couple of weeks into the administration, to be fair. Nevertheless, he tripped over his feet to her desk, and across it he slid a file, stuffed to the height of turkey club where the sandwich-maker has been incredibly withholding. Eleanor Galloway looked at the urgently red stamped title and scoffed.

"You're not serious."

"Not normally. But there have been...developments."

Eleanor's eyes almost rolled themselves. "Fine." She flipped through the pages. First, she was angry at having her time wasted. When she turned the last photograph over, she was confused. "Is it possible?"

"Short answer: maybe. The Canadians certainly think so."

"The Canadians? But...them?" A staffer came to the door.

"Mrs. President, CNN is here for the Refugee Piece."

"Yeah, it'll just be a minute," said Eleanor.

Franklin started up again. "Our people picked up some disturbing communications. And it's crazy given how New Agey and frankly strange that era in our defense program was but..well they specifically used the phrase 'weather modification device'."

"...modification? Jesus."

"My thoughts exactly. They don't know we know. The crux of the intercepted communication is really that the PM has sent a couple of agents out to find and retrieve something called Project Witchdoctor. Now we don't know what it is exactly, but it has something to do with modified weather and it was serious enough for them to not want to tell us so the worst guess is that it's some kind of weather weapon or somesuch."

"The Canadians?" Eleanor was having particular difficulty stomaching that detail. "Jesus. What about our pact to tell each other about that stuff, huh?"

"They must not care."

"What about NATO?"

"Same."

"Well follow their agents and let's see what happens. Fuck. The Canadians?" Eleanor got up from her desk and walked to the door just as the staffer returned. Franklin left behind her.

- The Canadians don't actually know if Idris Klein has anything, but when they show up, there's this massive overreaction she's got, prompting things to quickly spiral out of control

### Thesis Defense

Naram-Sin Nazari - Naz for short but he really just liked to be called Naram - Naram was walking home from a bar, happily drunk. He'd just earned his master's degree, in Meteorological Adaptation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It had been long nights and hours of research and planning. But it had also been a lot of fun. His head was too foggy to dredge up each fond memory individually, but he could recall a wash of smiling faces and shenanigans he probably couldn't have gotten into had he stayed home, in Kuwait City. And now he was going back. To sell air conditioners. More on that later.

Naram fumbled around with the key to his apartment, managing to get the door to open finally on the fifth try. His apartment was like a crypt. Impossibly black, unnervingly quiet, and tinged by the faint odor of decay. Vladimir hadn't taken out his garbage before he left. Naram chuckled. The Russian had been a terrible roommate from the very first day.

Even in the absolute dark, Naram could sense that something about that main room had changed since he'd left. He felt like he wasn't alone. His heart began to pound. "Hello!" he called out into the black apartment. Nothing. He ran his hand over the wall next to the door for the light switch and as soon as his finger hit the knobbly protrusion of plastic, he flipped it.

The something that had changed was a box, just shorter than he was, but maybe three times wider, situated a foot to the left of the true center of the living room. Scrawled on the side in black permanent marker were the words: Project Witchdoctor. He recognized the handwriting as that of his thesis advisor, Idris Klein, probably the world's foremost expert in the esoteric and shunned field of Meteorological Adaptation. His phone rang just then, and sure enough, it was Idris.

Naram felt sick. (jump?)

"Hello?" he said into the phone.

"Oh come on Naram, you know it's me, no need for the hellos and all that. Are you drunk? Well, I should ask more precisely, how drunk are you?"

Naram tossed his jacket on the ground. "Seven on a ten point."

The voice on the other end halted. "Not great. Please start drinking some water or jogging around in place or something. I'll need you sober. That said, one benefit of your present lack of sobriety is that you'll probably not be too terribly upset with me when I tell you that I've decided not to accept the defense of your thesis. Presently. I will, but first there's a kind of *quid pro quo* scenario."

"You're not serious."

"Terribly. Fatally so even. I need you to take what's in this box somewhere. I'd explain more but I can't. I doubt they're listening in but you know, never underestimate your enemies and all that."

The room took on a distinctly, Salvador-Dalian quality, which is to say that everything seemed to melt and twirl in flagrant violation of the nature of reality, and Naram rushed into the bathroom and threw up into the toilet. To his dismay this is also when he discovered that frequently absent-minded Vladimir had also neglected to flush. Naram ripped a towel from the cabinet and wiped his face vigorously. "Who?" he asked.

"The Feds!"

"What! Holy shit. FBI?"

"No."

"CIA?"

"No. CSI."

Naram walked back to the box. "What, like the show? What're you talking about?"

"Canadian Security Intelligence. Service. So CSIS I guess."

"Wait, hold on. The Canadians?"

"Look I can't really get into it now. All I can say is there's more info in the box. It'll tell you how to find me. Tell no one. Don't talk to anyone, but especially don't talk to anyone you suspect might be even slightly Canadian."

"Look, I'm still confused, and I'm not sure I -- "

"-- there's a moving van out back. I left it in your lot. I wouldn't have involved you if there was more time, but there isn't. You should leave within the hour." Idris hung up. Naram stared at the box and wondered how he was going to get this thing down four flights of stairs.

### Confederates

There was loud knocking on the door, whilst Naram attempted to clean up the variously sticky and wet situation in the bathroom. His heart leaped against the walls of his chest. In his panic he automatically reached for a weapon. As he headed to the door he noticed that he had grabbed the plunger.

"Who is it?" he called shakily. He flipped the plunger over, so the rubber end was pointing up. At the very least, he figured, if this was a small Quebecois hit squad, he might be able to incapacitate the first one via a plunger to the face, and then the rest of them would be so caught up puzzling over the sheer absurdity of what had just happened that he just might be able to sneak through and make a break for it. He didn't actually like the plan, but he was more reluctantly committed to it with every step.

"Naram just open the door please." It was Jin. It *sounded* like Jin. But how could he know? He was, after all, in a pretty unprecendented situation and there was no telling how skilled the Canadians actually were since he'd never heard of the CSIS. Who's to say it wasn't a recording, or some device that enabled them to say anything they wanted and sound exactly like Jin? He'd seen that in a movie once. He opened the door but not all the way, just enough for him to see out into the hall with one eye.

"Yes?"

"Seriously?" It was indeed Jin. With a suitcase. And also DQ.

"What're you doing here?" he asked, opening the door, and then rushing passed them into the room, so he could awkwardly put himself between them and the box.

"Yeah. We know about the box Naram," said Jin. DQ had nothing but a backpack and she tossed that onto the ground before diving onto the already ailing futon. The futon groaned as she touched down.

"I thought you were going back to Shanghai." said Naram to Jin.

"I was. *Am*. But then...this. She called us both." DQ waved from the futon.

"Yeah. So, you weren't gonna say bye? I mean, you knew I'd be over at The Spot. You coulda, I mean, I was waiting for -- "

Jin's eyes veered off to a corner of the ceiling. " -- I know. I was going to, there's just...it's a lot. I've been thinking about a lot of things and...I wasn't sure if...I don't even know if we -- "

DQ flipped over on the futon and exhaled loudly. " -- Oh my god. Just date already."

"Shut up," said Jin, casting an incendiary glare in DQ's direction.

"Well," said DQ, "as much as this is really turning out to be one of the better episodes in this little Soap Opera of yours, I'm of the opinion that we should get this thing in the van and get on the road."

### A Cold Day in July

(the flashback should be about a specific incident)

DQ was driving. Jin was sitting in the passenger seat. Naram was trying to sleep it off. He fell asleep almost as soon as DQ pulled off the lot. The last piece of the real world that he took with him into his dreams was the constant buzz of the engine, which morphed, layers of sleep down, into the sound that filled his entire childhood. The Air Conditioner.

"Sick of the heat? Come to Fuwaz Nazari Air Conditioning Solutions, to get all of your air conditioning needs solved!" ran the commercial. Nazari Air Conditioning Systems was the third most popular line of air conditioners in Kuwait City. There were only three. To sum it up simply, growing up for Naram had always been...tense.

"What am I not doing?" asked Fuwaz, of nobody in particular. Fatma, his wife, cleaned up the dinner and Naram helped. This became something of a ritual after the sunny days of the air conditioner business were over. Fatma and Naram would tend the weeds of life, cleaning and whatnot, while Fuwaz stewed. That day, Fuwaz was upset because there was a new player in the local air conditioner game. A wunderkind and a foreigner. Liam and Sons.

"You know, I don't even think he's got sons. He's projecting this image of an established family business and it's all a lie!"

"A total lie" said Fatma. She glared at Naram to get him to say something.

"That guy's a faker dad."

"Oh don't patronize me," Fuwaz said with a humph. "They think *he's* going to get The Contract."

Fuwaz was obsessed with the contract. It didn't make much sense. Fuwaz probably mentioned The Contract, Naram figured, something like ten times a day.  It became his goal in life to obtain this contract, yet there was no reason for him to expect that it was even a remote possibility. The Contract was a contract with the government of Kuwait City to build a rainmaking system. The area, in recent years had been stricken by deleterious droughts. Abu Dhabi already had a rainmaking system, though it wasn't clear if it even worked. Fuwaz wasn't all too concerned with the difficulties of building an effective system or actually bringing relief to those suffering during this spectacularly arid age in the region. Fuwaz was concerned with the fact that The Contract was worth three billion dollars. USD.

"They're similar. It's what I keep telling people. If you think about it, air conditioners are really atmospheric modifiers, just on a small scale. Same thing. Basically." Fuwaz would say this a couple times a day as well. In his fervor bordering on obsession, Fuwaz sent Naram to Abu Dhabi to intern in the government, specifically with the department responsible for the ionizers. A Cold War spy kind of setup wherein Naram was supposed to blend in and return with all of the Abu Dhabian secrets. Undetected, naturally. Naram was avidly interested in science of all sorts, but was not at all on board with the rainmaker espionage scheme. Of course he went anyways, he had no choice, but he was hardly successful.

Which meant added pressure when it was time for Naram to go to school. Fuwaz, historically, held a staunch, anti-western worldview. But when Naram got into MIT something changed. "You can save the company," he said to Naram on the day he was leaving. "Get your degrees and come back and we'll reinvent Nazari Air Conditioning Systems. We can even call it Fuwaz and Son's. Once we get that contract, we'll call it whatever you want."

Tires shrieked and tossed Naram's drunken bumble through the past directly into the proverbial Shredder. Groggily, Naram sat up and looked out the windows of the van. He couldn't see anything but fog in every direction. "Where are we?" he asked.

"No idea," said Jin. "DQ has no idea."

"Well I'm sorry that *DQ* can't see a gd thing! Little miss fall asleep and leave DQ by herself to drive in the middle of the night when she's just as tired as you are and -- "

"How close are we, time wise?"

DQ checked the map on her phone. "Fifteen minutes. Christ dude, are you gonna answer that?"

Naram was confused at first. Then, with bloodflow increasing, and sensation returning to his extremities, he noticed a gentle vibration on his thigh. His phone was ringing.

(We see Fuwaz resentment for jiddo, who went into philosophy)

(this ends with them meeting Idris in the fog and her giving them the dossier as well as sending them Oslo Diggins)


### Touchy Subject

(You're introduced to the agents and they talk about what they both think about Winston)

(Where do they get on the trail?)

(they're in the same diner as the one the Crew is going to, in order to avoid them. They'll actually pass one another as the agents leave (farce))

"How'd you get assigned to The Unit?" asked Ezra Fournier.

Bernard Glick woofed down a too-large bite of his eggs benedict. There was no way to chew it without exposing the contents of his mouth to half the restaurant. "I don't think we're there yet champ."

"C'mon. You're gonna have to tell me the story sooner or later."

Glick stared back blankly. Fournier couldn't look away from the churning, tragedy of masticated eggs and english muffin and hollandaise.

"I'll tell you mine alright? How about that?"

Glick loaded another forkful into his tireless, gaping, maw. Fournier was transfixed. He was imagining himself sucked into that blackhole of destruction, taken apart, stringified and then... "Could you, just, I don't know, maybe just close your mouth a little?" Glick complied. "Thanks."

Fournier took up his coffee and sipped. His eyes glossed over and he rested his mug on top of his recently distended stomach, the unfortunate fate of so many middle aged men. "I'm a good agent, you know. You have to be to get where we are."

"Sure sure," said Glick.

"It's a damn shame that a lot of people don't take us seriously. Damn shame. We do good work. Mostly. Now, if I'm being honest, the thing that got me put on The Unit, is part of the reason people think we're a joke. You remember the Newfoundland Incident?"

Glick chuckled then caught himself. "Yeah. Of course. Terrible, just...awful stuff."

"Three bodies in total. You ever seen a body Glick?" Fournier's eyes were haunted. Glick shook his head. "Before that, me neither. Three bodies Glick. Three. Jack The Ripper stuff. I was out there, I was an ace, and I had a partner and we were supposed to stop this guy. I was confident I was going to get this bastard. Ultimately...I helped him get away." Glick agonized and pleaded with his face, trying to squelch the incipient grin he could feel coming. "I've never told anyone how it happened exactly. But since...well I'll tell you. This guy....he was a hell of an actor. A real Ryan Gosling this guy. Real chops."

"Gosling? Ryan?"

"Yeah."

"Really? I -- Drive was alright I guess, but that seems like a reach to me. It's kinda -- "

Fournier put his coffee on the table. "I'm sorry I didn't think -- it was the first -- I mean Gosling's good right? I mean -- Crazy Stupid Love?"

"Oh that's right! He *was* in that. True. Ok, okay."

"Yeah. Exactly, so back to my story. So we find that third body. Just poked to shit, full of holes, like a pin cushion. And it's just on the beach. My partner is thinking about quitting, you can understand a guy wanting to quit after seeing that stuff, which he did ultimately, and I'm well, I'm pretty sure there and then that my career is toast. And then this guy runs up. This dead girl's brother. Guy looks like a car just hit him when he sees the body. Totally demolished. Waterfalls of tears. Floods."

"A *deluge.*"

"Exactly. And so, he says how their mom is still at work and he needs to go grab her. And he's patting his body looking for his keys, totally out of sorts. This guy is breaking my heart Glick. I offer my keys. It was a rental. It's not like I gave him the keys to the cruiser or anything. Still, that guy was gone after that. And we were stranded, and by the time we put it all together, my career was *definitely* over. I had no choice but to jump on The Unit. That or not have a job. I guess I might've written something, but, I don't know. Everyone says that."

"That's...crazy."

"I know. So, you ready? What's your pitiful tale Bernie?"

"Eh, not that. Not Bernie. Just Glick."

"Okay then."

### Now and Forever

"Hello?"

"Again with this? The Diner. Now."

(I don't what Idris says in the diner)

(the machine is all cutting edge laser technology and massive and relies heavily on some not still manufactured ultra-corporate sounding chemical (Dyn-o-gel))

(meg-o-gel)

On their way in Jin, DQ, and Naram walked by a couple of gentleman, a behemoth and very average-sized man of about forty, walking out. "Thanks," the three said, as the larger of the two men held the door open. You don't see that sort of thing all the time these days.

Idris Klein was a hard woman to miss. She was a boisterous woman, exuberant in every atom of her being, and somehow possessed the quality of being deafeningly, unignorably loud without saying a single word. That diner was popular, packed from sun up to sun down. Still, they saw Idris in her booth instantly.

Jin, DQ, and Naram sat down. Idris didn't look at them. Instead she began constructing a fort with the menus in the rack on top of the table, leaving spaces for each of their heads, but leaving no seams for inspection from the outside. Idris stuck her head in and the three followed suit.

"You have the device?" she asked.

"Isn't this a little over the top? Aren't we attracting more attention than anything?" probed Naram.

"Yes or no."

"Yes." said DQ. "No thanks to either of these two."

"Great. Shut up. Here, take this." Idris' eyes wandered to the top of the menu fort as she began concentrating deeply. A few seconds later, Naram felt something hit his foot. He picked it up, which was difficult because he was hunched over and keeping his head in the confines of the fort of menus. Ultimately he found a biblical mass of paper and duct tape and staple and twine; that phrase -- Project Witchdoctor -- was again scribbled over the cover. "Got it?"

"Yeah...what is this?" asked Naram.

"Your inheritance."

"What?" the three asked simultaneously. Naram flipped through the pages cautiously, since it was collapsing and crumbling like a medieval manuscript on haggard velum. About a third of the pages were singed at the corners or nearly charred all the way through, beyond the point of decipherability. Every now and again he'd flit passed an image of lab-coated scientists with horn-rimmed glasses, either deliberating or transfixedly observing something that had been burned off. In a few the image was overexposed and overwhelmed by some eyeball-shriveling light source, and the scientists looked on through obsidian goggles.

"It's all in there" said Idris. "But for the past few years you've been helping build what's in the box. The history of which is all detailed in that book."

"Wait. I'm confused. *What's* in the box?" asked DQ.

"It's *in* the book. I just said that. Now, just take it and lay low. I'm going to get back to you in a couple of days. There's some people that should be able to help. I really appreciate the help. To be honest, I've already approved your theses. I'm not going to rescind. But do *this*. I'll write any recommendations you need. Anything."

Jin plunged her head deeper into the fort. "What the hell is going on? Naram and I can't just around. I've got plans. Interviews. And Naram...well he's got to get back home. Sell air conditioners."

"*Ahem*" A waitress, Beatrice, was standing at the booth. "Are y'all gonna order anything or...?"

"Toast. Coffee." said Idris.

"We really haven't looked at the menus," explained Jin.

"Too much playing around? Too much fun with the menus, which *I'm* gonna have to clean up? I have to disinfect each one a patron touches you know. I'll be back in five."

The four of them sat in silence until the waitress came back. Jin ordered orange juice and eggs. Just the whites, which made Naram roll his eyes. DQ ordered the Lumber Jack breakfast, and Naram was deciding between that and something called The Stack, but eventually he stammered his way into ordering the same thing as DQ. He said he didn't want to be difficult.

### Paradise in the snow
Oslo Diggins was the kind of man who sits in his hottub, at the zenith of his latest ski resort in Walhalla, North Dakota, and stares down at all of it for hours on end. When he's done he puts on silk boxers and pajamas and a robe, all of it silk, even the ascot. And then he'll smoke in a study devoid of everything but a rocking chair and the snarling, taxidermied head of a wolf. It's one he killed himself. He didn't hunt it or anything. He ran it over during one of those all-too-common whiteout situations that they have in North Dakota. It was a runt and sick on top of that. The pelt still had tire tracks in it. Truth be told, Oslo couldn't bear to look at the thing. It was part of an ever failing attempt to accept responsibility for the death he caused out in the world. And there had been a lot of it.

Oslo Diggins was barely keeping hold on a mind that seemed hell bent on getting lost ever since about two years prior. Because two years ago, Oslo Diggins killed Gates Diggins. His father. A millionaire, philanthropist, former Alpine Skiing Olympian, and a pretty good father at the end of the day if Oslo was forced to deal with the psychical pain and think about it. Pushed him right off the ski lift. There were messy details like just how he managed to get the safety bar up and how then, he managed to throw the notoriously hardy old man from the lift when he himself was such a disappointment physically, but those are lost to time. Oslo had blacked it all out. Shook the hell out of the etch-a-sketch that was his troubled mind. He hardly remembers that day. And nobody else knows about it. Of course they know that Gates Diggins is dead and all that. But not *who* killed him. By that point, everyone had seemed to stop caring. Business was booming.

Someone else came into the room. Doug. A henchman in Oslo's mind. Doug preferred to think of himself as a business partner. "Sir, someone put a batch up for sale on the internet. Some rando. Looks legit though."

"You have the number?" asked Oslo.

"Yes sir."

"Phone." Doug walked to the corner of the room and picked up the phone. It was old, with faded brass, and a dial instead of a number pad. Oslo bought it because he felt it was the kind of phone Rockefeller would have used. This was not at all true. John D Rockefeller was a personal hero of Oslo's.

Oslo dialed the number after a few false starts. There was no answer.

### The Incredible Internet

"Just like that, huh?" said Craig Jones. His son, Tony, was behind him, inspecting the web form his father had just filled out on the computer, a lumbering, paleolithic thing on dial-up.

"Yep. Looks right to me," said Tony, and then he clicked the submission button. Seconds later, Craig Jones was a seller on Craigslist. Obviously, he was not the eponymous Craig.

"Well I'll be dipped. That's mindblowing, right there. Truly."

"Sure," said Tony, who had already moved on from the wonders of Craigslist, and was busy checking if anyone had liked his latest tweet on his phone. Tony scuffled away while his father continued to marvel. It *was* amazing, when you stopped to think about it. Just that morning Craig began an excavation of The Shed In Back that he had been avoiding for years. Until yesterday when his wife, Lucretia, went to trim her rosebushes in the front yard and couldn't find her sheers. Yet another gardening utensil swallowed up by The Shed. Lucretia, as of yesterday, had finally seen enough home-maintenance-miscellany bloodshed at the hands of the The Shed in Back. Craig had to clean the shed, and would be sleeping on the couch until it was done.

Craig had never cleaned out the shed because there were ghosts there, phantasms especially reserved for Craig himself. You see, Lucretia and Craig and Tony lived in the house Craig had lived in his entire life and inherited from his parents. The Shed had been his father's private workplace and had always been strictly off limits to young Craig Jones. Craig Jones' father had been a scientist, a Canadian, and involved in some very odd kinds of science, naturally. Mysterious lances of light would emanate from the shed at the weirdest hours of the night, not to mention the noises that'd slip through the padlocked crease in The Shed's doors. The entire neighborhood was spooked, and nobody really associated with Craig Jones' father or the Jones family in general. That was difficult for young Craig Jones. In many ways, Craig Jones had never forgiven his father. So The Shed In Back was basically the locus of Craig's perfectly understandable daddy issues, unresolved anger and the kinds of monstrous childhood fears that people bury and take to their grave. Craig Jones had never set foot in The Shed until that morning.

It was a mess. There were dusted and cracked vacuum tubes and chipped beakers leaking faintly phosphorescent ooze. There was even a skeleton. A dog. Craig Jones leaned over to inspect it, reading the tag hanging from his collar, and in doing so solved the case of what had happened to  his dog Rocket, whom his father said ran away. It was possible that Rocket had been a casuality in the unstoppable march of science, but it was also just as possible that Rocket had wandered out to the shed with Craig Jones' father and his father had just forgotten about the dog entirely until Rocket was nothing but a pile of bones. Craig Jones' father was notoriously forgetful. There was also a dusty case containing about fifteen tubes of something called Meg-o-gel.

"Well what do I do with it?" Craig Jones asked his wife and son. The kitchen table was covered with all of the dusty curiosities from The Shed.

"Toss it," said Lucretia, who was just happy to have her gardening sheers back. The rosebushes had gotten all out of sorts since they'd been lost.

*Toss it* was a less than optimal solution for Craig Jones. Residue of his painful childhood or no, it didn't seem right to Craig Jones to just throw it all away.

"You could sell it," said Tony.

"No," said Lucretia. "We're not having a yard sale. The house is in disarray. If people see things like this they'll think we're slobs and Philistines."

"No one would come," said Craig.

"Not in *real* life. Jeez you two are really just -- on the internet," said Tony. To that point Craig Jones relationship with the internet was something like fire to neolithic man, for him it was indistinguishable from magic. Craig Jones couldn't trust something he didn't understand.

As Craig Jones viewed his items for sale online, he still didn't understand it, but -- and maybe this was just undue confidence from having expunged a lot of daddy-related messiness in the form of The Shed -- he was ready to embrace whatever came next. Two days later he received a phone call.

"Hello, um, is this Mr. Jones?"

"Yes, who is this?"

"Hiya, well, I saw that you're selling some Meg-o-gel on your site, and I'd like to buy. Name's Fournier by the way,  Ezra Fournier."

"Oh wow. This is wonderful. Did you, uh, were you just gonna stop by then?"

"Yeah. Sure. I can be there tomorrow. This is atypical, me being a collector and all, but from the pictures I can tell that this is a particularly good batch, and I was wondering if I could make an agreement to buy them in advance."

"Well I suppose that's alright," said Craig Jones. He could hardly believe this was all happening. He was giddy, smiling spasmodically. His palms were sweating and he had at least three close calls with dropping the phone. "I don't have any experience with the stuff. How much were you thinking Mr. Fournier?"

"How much do you want?"

Craig Jones actually *did* drop the phone this time, and it clanked to the ground, and as he scrambled to pick it up he accidentally kicked it which sent it skidding all the way to the opposite end of the kitchen, underneath a cabinet full of China. He contorted awkwardly on his trying to get the phone.

"Hello?" came Fournier's diminished electronic voice from beneath the cabinet. "Hello? Mr. Jones?"

Craig Jones contorted and twisted a bit more desperately. His spine and various joints were straining themselves in ways he'd never asked them to. He strained a bit more, too much actually, and he pulled or twisted or dislodged something in his back. He had retrieved the phone though. "Hello?" said Craig into the gunk-covered receiver, voice hoarse with agony.

"Oh! Hello Mr. Jones. Thought I lost ya!" The two laughed cordially, Craig Jones in short bursts, as every unnecessary breath sent him to the verge of tears. "Are you alright Mr. Jones?"

"Just great. One hundred dollars." He had to expedite things, since the mere act of conversation had become unbearable.

"Great! Well, I'll see you tomorrow Mr. Jones."

Craig slid the phone along the kitchen floor, and then he lied down on his back, motionless, taking in only the shallowest breaths possible. He was that on his back in the kitchen all day until it got dark. His wife found him like that when she finally returned home from her annual Night Out With The Girls. In all that time, the phone rang only once. It was an unknown number from North Dakota.

### Cacoethes
(eventually the box just has to be opened)
(what's the best way to reveal parts of this backstory, especially as its being unearthed in this manuscript? without seeming too expository, just a rush of facts)
(also lay the groundwork for this group wanting to find out more of the mystery, firstly, figuring out exactly what happens when they run the machine with the meg-o-gel -> which glows faintly)

The gang, instead of jumping hand in had off a cliff from sheer boredom was watching television. Naram remembered the couple of days before that purely in terms of a steady stream of bungled attempts to become a millionaire, court cases where defendants sought remuneration for the stress of having to appear on court television, and crime procedurals where everyone was far too good-looking to be involved in their purported line of work. A horror movie was on. Naram wasn't interested.

(Who could be interested in something where every character seems fascinated with doing things that'll obviously only immanitize their own typically gory demise. Why the inexplicable fascination with staring the horrifying unknown in its toothy face?

"I've gotta open it," said DQ. (the joke here being what's going on in Naram's head and how that relates to what DQ is saying here.)

### The End



### The End, really (this is more of a prologue)
(DQ needs to be somewhere in the epilogue)
Naram sat in his chair on the cafe patio under the awning. He was drinking tea. It was raining. The street was dead except for one bubble of ecstatic life, a group of five kids, kicking a ball through the pooling puddles. Naram heard shuffling footsteps behind him.

"You're late." Naram turned around. His father shuffled towards him on his cane, Fatma guiding him from behind.

"I don't work for you, what do you care?" said Naram, smiling.

Fatma helped Fuwaz into a seat, across from Naram. Fatma sat down next to him. "I know. But I'm old. I keep a tight schedule." Fuwaz looked out at the kids playing. "You know, I've been thinking. Talking with your mother. It almost rains *too* much now. Don't you think?" Fatma slapped his hand, scolding him. "What? You *did* say that."

Footsteps echoed at the front of the cafe, accompanied by luggage clicking along the tiles.

"Hey mom. Dad. You ready Naram?" Jin leaned down, kissed Naram, and then hugged Fatma and Fuwaz.

"I just got here actually, hon. Hadn't really gotten in my morning tea with mom and dad." Jin checked her watch.

"Fine, fine. We'll reschedule." The gaggle of children had moved closer, and a kick gone awry sent he ball under the awning. Jin picked the ball up and walked it out from underneath the awning, tossed it back into play. She stared up at the sky through all the falling water, like she was looking for the spot where, somewhere above all the clouds, someone had turned over a cosmic bucket. Turning to Naram she said, "You think we overdid it with the ionizers? Too much mego?"

"This is what we were saying!" exclaimed Fuwaz. Fatma hit him again.

Naram laughed.


# Appendix

(there's something they need to figure out, although I was anticipating that it was the sm's who burned down the lab. What's missing? What could they be searching for?)
(idris makes a cursory reference to the supranational meteorologists. The weathermen since she's got a plan to reach out to Gates Diggins. A plan which ultimately gets her killed.)
(something about the essentialness of the now incredibly rare and nigh-defunct meg-o-gel) <- maybe there isn't any and they need to find some

(why now for the canadians? Who / what shot the starting gun?)
(some guy try's to sell some meg-o-gel on Craigslist -> this is the starting gun)
(why does Idris then get all flighty? does she get a call from some canadians or something? I like the thought of her getting scared largely due to a misunderstanding)
(maybe the Canadians have been following up with anyone to get some kind of gauge of the situation. Maybe Glick and Fournier haven't been fully apprised of the situation)

(Oslo Diggins relies on the volatile substance meg-o-gel for his own efforts with the weather modification machines he uses at his father's resorts.)

(Using the machine, loading it up wit)

(Ultimately Oslo starts hunting the kids because they've stolen some of the mego-o-gel)

(they receive a call from Idris phone from the people that killed her, so does Fournier)

(the gang, after they run the machine, they find themselves in the predicament of needing to save themselves, without really being able to appeal to outside authorities because the nature of what the device)

(Oslo and his father had a lot of disagreements over the use of meg-o-gel)

# Train of thought

Curie breathed. Her heart was pushing up against her sternum it was beating so hard. She looked around. Mass-produced paintings hung on the wall. She was sitting on an impeccably made bed. She was in a hotel. It had happened again. The telltale sign was this feeling that she'd just emerged from somewhere deep underwater just in the nick of time. She didn't know where she was. For a few moments there, she didn't know who she was. It was happening more frequently.

A file cluttered her desk. Everything she needed to know would be in there. She knew that. Some of the more important details were coming into focus. She was there on business. There was an idea They wanted her to grab. She was in Manhattan, Kansas.

She picked up the file. The first page was a refresher. It was about who she was. They only did that if you were on the brink. Being a Surrogate for long enough screwed with your head. The episodes became more frequent. She was stage four. She could tell that because everything was on that first page. Her name, where she grew up, how her career had gone. Best case scenario she'd have a case one day, and die. Worst case, they'd retire her at the end of the year. Send her to one of the Palaces. They said you didn't have to do anything there, didn't even have to feed yourself. What They didn't say was that by the time a Surrogate retired to a Palace they couldn't feed themselves.

The Meme she was after was gestating in the brain of a high school junior. Sahara Jones. She lived in cul de sac a couple of minutes away. Curie had a company car.

Moments or eons later Curie found herself on the side of the road, in the car, staring straight ahead. It was dark. She recognized the house on her right from the file. One story painted in that bland, offwhite, everycolor. Last thing she remembered she was sitting on a hotel bed.

A car pulled up in front of the house. A girl got out, waved back to her friends. Sahara. Curie figured she had thirty seconds before the girl reached the front door. 29. 28. She was waiting for the car to pull away from the curb. 26. 25. There. Curie autonomically reached for the glove compartment and retrieved a long hypodermic needle. Curie went up the driveway. There seemed to be no other sound than the girl's boots clacking into the blacktop. Curie's own footfalls were eaten up by ambient, nighttime noises: rustling leaves, the hum of electricity in the streetlamps. Sahara hit the top of the driveway. Curie wasn't going to make it. The car had cost her precious seconds. She was as good as retired. Then Sahara stopped, twenty feet from the front door, to look at a message on her phone. The needle was in and Sahara's waking mind was already falling away before she could even manage to scream.

This was the part where the panic started. Adrenaline, like refrigerant, dripped coolly through Curie's extremities. These were her clearest moments. She could remember that she'd done exactly this before, dragged a limp body along some dark corridor. She recalled that moment and the stunning realization that a human body is so much heavier when it's lifeless. The gnawing at the tattered corners of her mind was familiar too. It was the last desiccated and feeble vestige of her conscience. She'd killed it slowly. But you get hungry enough, you sink deep enough into self-loathing and you're willing to do a lot of pretty bad things. There were few other ways she could've dragged herself from the gutter. Even as smart as she was. The robots had eaten all the jobs, so in a way, it was all their fault, not hers.

She drove the girl to the park. Even in Manhattan, Kansas the side of the road felt too exposed. She checked the girl's breathing. Normal. Curie went to the trunk to retrieve the Prometheus device. It was surprisingly compact for a device so remarkable. Four pads for each of the subjects' temples, a lead running from each pad to the base of the device, which was housed in a case the size of carry-on luggage. Steps: attach the pads and turn on the device. It'd run until it was done. Quick and mostly painless. There were micro-barbs on the pads which was a bit unpleasant initially. Normally, the process took three runs to be complete, the idea fully "mapped" to the recipient's brain and "demapped" from the seeder.

Curie placed the Prometheus on the back seat and attached the pads to the girl. The Curie attached her own. She touched the switch. Mapping while not directly painful, was horribly uncomfortable. In order for the idea to gestate properly in the recipient, any memory, idea, or emotion from which the Meme had sprung within the seeder needed to replicated in the Surrogate. These were sometimes excruciating to bear. Child abuse. Near-death experiences. Heart break. The Surrogate took these all on as their own. And the core that Curie could feel withering away would be further sandblasted to oblivion.

She flipped the switch.

There was initial, extreme vertigo, which was typical. The memories flooded in. A father whose face was disappearing from her mind every day. A rage boiling in the stomach. A love. A mother who's love was immense. A mother who was disappearing atom by atom, memory by memory. The all-consuming, compulsion to stop it.

Curie emerged. Sunlight bled into the car, drowning it in aquamarine and orange. Sahara was still asleep. The Prometheus murmured on the back seat. She flipped the switch.

The second actuation was where idea began to grow beyond its current form, warping into what it was ultimately meant to be.

Curie gasped for air. The sun was sinking on the edge of town. She flipped the switch for the last time.

Curie's fear is returning to the state of her past. Mostly, the feelings of inadequacy, uselessness, moreso than being hungry and poor

there's this is emblematic of doing what you shouldn't, what's bad for you, for outside reasons. She can save herself with this idea, but its also the idea that will make her obsolete

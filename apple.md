something about how shes playing video games and doesn't get out a lot and sort of this odd mystery at school since, well, this art forger and doesn't really fit in.

she doesn't yet know khan although she does interact with him online in this game. I don't want to delve too deeply into the game stuff.

I built the shed out back when I was ten. It's less of a shed or more of a miniature house. I got the blueprints online. These days you can figure out how to do almost anything online. Do your makeup. Hack a computer. Build a bomb. When I was nine I found out that you could learn how to forge paintings. There was just a guy making YouTube videos about it. His name is Jasper and he used to live half an hour away from my house. Now he lives about two hours away. In prison. He got cocky which, ironically, is Jasper's rule number one: *don't get cocky*.

My parents fell on hard times after Jasper got arrested. They nearly got divorced. Money is such a dumb thing to get divorced over. I thought so. And so did Mr. M. He became a secret benefactor for my parents, buying up my dad's art and my mom's books. They're not very good.

Full disclosure: I'm Mr. M.
